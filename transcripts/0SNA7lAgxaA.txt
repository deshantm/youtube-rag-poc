essential steps you need to take
to launch your concierge practice
[Music]
hey my name's dr aaron lebauer and i
help physical therapists like you scale
their time income and impact
so be sure you hit subscribe and click
the notification bell so you get
notified of the next videos
today what we're going to do is talk
about exactly what you need to do
to launch your physical therapy practice
as a concierge
practice or a mobile pt practice their
concierge and mobile pt
are somewhat similar some people think
concierge
what they're thinking is a high level of
service we come to you
that's value added great mobile pt's
somewhat similar
more people think of it more of like a
home health outpatient physical therapy
for people they're very similar two
different words
slight differences so i want you to
understand a few things before we get
into the list is that
the differences are somewhat semantic in
my mind they may be very different than
yours
you need to understand that you're
bringing a ton of value to people by
traveling to them
even though most people who choose
mobile or concierge because they don't
have a high overhead of renting a brick
and mortar
space i did mobile therapy for about
eight years
before i got a clinic and in my clinic
space
that allowed me to see one person per
hour for five hours in the day i could
see my five people a day and leave
rather than
five people spread out over an eight
hour day even if you're starting now
or you're watching this because you're
thinking about getting started and doing
mobile or concierge is a good way to do
a side hustle it is
and thinking long term once you get busy
what you need to think about
is am i going to hire someone else
because this is the long-term value
proposition or
am i going to eventually find a place
especially if i start earning enough
money to see patients quit my job so i
want you to understand that
four thousand dollars a month goal is
too small you should be aiming for six
figures
which is eighty eight thousand three
hundred and thirty three dollars a month
what does that look like to me in my
practice
well if you're charging what i'm
charging and what i teach most of my
platinum mastermind members to charge
and how to
enroll people into your services that's
about eight new patients a month it's
actually less
it's about six new patients a month
about two people a week can you get two
new people a week
onto an eight visit plan of care and if
you're charging what we're charging
you are making six figures so it's very
simple
but not always easy because it takes a
lot of work you have to learn not only
about just setting up your business but
you have to learn about sales you have
to speak directly to your client
and customer so i've got some notes
written down so i'm going to go through
my list on my phone
and share with you the nine essential
steps to start a concierge or
mobile physical therapy practice so
these are the things that
you need to know and need to start
thinking about and then there are some
details
like the details of exactly how to like
what are the links where the specific
things you need
so i'm going to go through the nine
essential steps and then i'm going to
share with you
what you can do next to get the rest of
the information because
there's not enough time in a you know 10
15 minute youtube video for me to teach
you
everything you need to know that's what
i do in my course uh the cash pt
blueprint which has
nine modules and probably 15
hours 20 hours of video trainings and
then we take people from the blueprint
to my
platinum mastermind group where we meet
three times a year we meet
multiple times a month on group calls so
there's some things that you need to
know right now
to get started and that's what i'm going
to share with you the the top nine
things that basically i wish i knew when
i started
was this took me over 20 years to figure
out and i'm going to share with you just
the next 10 minutes
so the number one thing you need to get
clear on is your why
like why am i starting my own business
why am i willing to go out of network
and do cash
why am i willing to put in all the work
because it's not good enough just to try
to escape a
bad shitty job what you need to be
working towards is some
goal of yours why is this important to
me why it's important to aaron is
because i want
time and money freedom and i want the
freedom to treat my patients
the way that i see fit not the way the
insurance is going to pay for or the way
the
doctor or referring physician wants me
to i want to be a decision maker in my
patient's journey
because i've seen so many people i know
what they need best and so that's why
i'm willing to go out of network and do
the hard work and wake up every day
the reason i'm here with you my why is
because i've seen too many people
get opioids and injections before pt
they're addicted to opioids they've had
surgery now
they've had an mri that scared them and
it's something that i could have easily
fixed i've had
dozens of people say dr lavar you're the
first person to touch me that where it
hurts
and now i feel so much better i've been
to see dozens of other people i want
that to stop
so that's my why and that's why i get
every day because being an entrepreneur
is a journey and it's not whether cash
pt or concierge pt
or mobile pt works it's whether you want
it to work for you and you have the
motivation to drive so you have to get
clear on your why and why is this so
important to you because
some days it's gonna be hard and
difficult doing the work and being
successful
takes action on your part so number two
you need to decide on your niche
your niche this is somewhat simple and
most people think the niche
is the body part on the shoulder we're
on the crossfit
dock on the on the acl like it's not a
body part or a condition
and it's not necessarily i'm the
mackenzie therapist that's not my niche
i'm the mfr therapist that's not my
niche that might be a specialty i have
but your niche is how you describe the
transformation
you help your patients make so libor
physical therapy we help active people
in greensboro
stay fit healthy and strong without pain
meds injections or surgery
your niche is who you help and what you
help them achieve
which is really your usp so you just got
a two for
two for one so think about that usp
unique serving proposition or unique
value proposition so then number three
is you have to know your avatar you have
to know them by name
you have to know them like in your mind
you close your eyes and i know who i'm
speaking to
right now when i'm making videos for my
clinic i know
who i'm speaking to because i know their
pain their problems their struggles i
know their income i know whether they
work i know
the types of kids they have you know how
their life is set up because i've
spent time writing it down being very
specific about who it is
so you have to know who your avatar is
and know just because you have a niche
and you have a very specific avatar
doesn't mean you can't help other people
but if you're speaking to everyone
you're going to help no one number four
you have to commit to the long game
like i said before this is going to work
it's whether
you want it to work for you and you're
committed but being committed you have
to know your why
and wins aren't just monetary wins or
satisfaction wins are getting done
like did i get in my lead magnet did i
build the website did i
get a table or figure out how do i track
miles
once i've figured out how am i going to
track my miles for tax purposes
now i got to win if there's an easy app
to do that great
you should have a really good accountant
that can help you with that maybe even
right off your car like you can
absolutely write off your car if you're
using it for work
in the right ways you have to commit to
the long game
because short-term wins are just
fleeting this is a long game
because you're making a career change or
you're making a business change
think about what is it going to take to
be successful 5-10 years down the road
look i've been doing this for over 20
years i wasn't successful right out of
the gate and
coaching other people i've helped them
become successful
five times faster than i was for
instance one of my private coaching
clients in platinum mastermind members
derek nielsen he launched a brand new
business
in durham north carolina he didn't know
a single person there
before he moved there he moved there
with his girlfriend who was going to
school to become a nurse practitioner
and using my systems and everything i
taught him and everything he learned
through my courses and programs
he was able to generate ten thousand
dollars in eight his first
eight weeks and fifteen thousand dollars
in his eighth month
and almost six figures in his first year
ninety six thousand two hundred seven
dollars in his
first year in business and he didn't
know a single person he didn't have any
referral sources
he didn't know any gym owners etc and
the guy who doesn't even like to go out
and do in person workshops he wants to
do it all
through facebook advertising and and
webinars and online systems
and derek and i sat down one time and i
was looking
at my schedule to see because he was
like well aaron i'm not getting busy
fast enough i'm like dude you're
crushing it
he's like no i'm not and i said okay
look let me go through my schedule and i
went through two years of my schedule it
took me
two years to do what derek did in 15
months and that's
numbers of patients on average for a
four month rolling period so
in derek's eighth month he was on
average seeing 15 to 16 people it took
me two years to do that and derek was
charging
twice as much as i was charging when in
that first two years
so derek uh was able to do what i did in
two years in just eight months
that's because of the coaching and
because he's one of my best students he
i
tell him what to do and he'll do it
occasionally he'll question me he's like
no i don't think so he was like oh you
were right
like i like being right but really what
i like doing is helping other people win
when you commit to the long game you
know that results
come when you invest your time your
energy
and even some money into the long game
because investments
you're never going to win in the stock
market if you're trying to play it every
day stock market wins in
real estate wins and investments are
made in long-term investments so think
about that
number five build your value don't
charge less just because you're
doing mobile pt or concierge because you
don't have a
overhead you do have overhead you just
don't have a clinic space you're renting
and i've got some of my mastermind
members in brooklyn
are charging you're paying 5 dollars a
month
um ben baggie was out in oakland i think
it was like fifty five hundred dollars a
month and he's just subleasing out there
and i got other people in places uh
paying a thousand dollars a month even
500 or subleasing other space for
twenty dollars per hour that they use it
build your value
just because you're not paying rent
doesn't mean that what you're doing
isn't valuable for people
i've seen people who are doing concierge
pt
wake up at 5 am drive 45 minutes go see
two people
and leave feeling like it wasn't worth
it it was too much time they were
spending and
i said well how much would you have to
charge for it to be absolutely worth it
every day for you to wake up and go
there three times a week
oh and he was like oh like 175 200 i
mean it's charging right around 100
visit it wasn't worth it i can tell you
what when you're working as a concierge
physical therapist
and you're actually treating people who
are executives who are high performers
they value their time so much that by
you coming to them
you're saving them a half hour of travel
on each end that could be worth a
thousand dollars to them so do not under
charge
i would actually say if you're gonna do
a concierge and actually be like i'm
high level concierge for high performers
and
and people that are too busy to come to
me then you need to charge a premium
because you're saving them tons of time
but you also need to build the value of
basically we come to you which saves you
time you're going to come to see me
three times a week
generally you're going to see a regular
person three times a week regular pt
three times a week you're gonna spend
three hours there
plus three hours of travel back and
forth typically my patients come to see
us once maybe twice a week you don't
even have to travel to us i'm saving you
three hours a week
plus i'm coming to you in the
convenience of your own home
office or gym which means more
comfortable for you
which means i can teach you things to do
at home that you can easily replicate
number one thing as a concierge physical
therapist you're saving other people
time and you're providing an amazing
level of service that they know no one
else is getting except them so if you're
charging them 125
an hour for that they're not going to
value it nearly as much as if you were
charging double if not more i would sell
them packages and programs
that are at least eight to 12 weeks as
long as it's something that they need
if they have a specific injury if it's a
quick easy fix like
sprained your ankle see them one to
three times i'm not saying cha
overcharge for that but charge for the
value that you bring to the table
number six get your legal documents in
place just because it's a
side hustle startup mobile or concierge
doesn't mean
you don't need the legal documents in
place a business
an official business you need to be able
to take a payment do your charting
and soap notes and make sure you have
liability insurance
and you have a business entity an npi
number one of the ways that goes through
all that
uh information one of the things that
you can get is the cash pt checklist
it's cash pt checklist dot com i've
listed out all the legal documents and
steps you need to take
to launch your cash practice and
concierge practice number seven set up
marketing systems
setting up marketing systems is
including your website and landing pages
for like
ebook or pelvic pt checklist other
systems where you're gonna send welcome
emails and thank you emails
thank you letters you need to set up
systems for your business because
businesses are only as good as the
systems not the people that run them
going all in on your processes and hire
great people to run your processes and
systems that includes you
as the physical therapist you're a
highly trained technician
as the business owner you need to set
the system so as you go through and
build your business you need to write
down every step in every
action piece and where things are
located so someone else can come behind
you and replicate it easily with the
right systems and software that's how
you're going to
leverage your time and expertise to
generate six figures and more
as a concierge or mobile pt number eight
i've seen a lot of people make this
mistake
you're smart you probably scored better
on the gre
than i did you know you're you've
done tons of con ed
and everything but where business is
concerned this is the time to check your
ego just like you want the
surgeon to check their ego when talking
to a patient who has back pain and they
tell them
never left more than 35 pounds well i'm
telling you when it comes to business
and systems
i get it you could probably figure this
all out on your own but wouldn't it be
awesome if you could like speed it up
wouldn't it be awesome if you didn't
have to
go through all the effort to reinvent
the wheel and prove to yourself that you
could create it too just because aaron's
created it well i can tell you this
is when it comes to business i work with
coaches i work with business coaches
because what business coaches
do is they give me back my time because
i don't have to go figure it out and try
it out
i know what's worked for someone else
and i go and install it my business
and i adapt it to my business and my
market my audience i started my
cash practice with a coach i started my
online business with a coach i have a
coach today it's a 50
000 a year coaching program i spent
hundreds of thousand dollars on
business coaching i've actually spent
more on business coaching than i did to
get my doctor physical therapy degree
and i suggest
you do the same because it's only going
to help you get your results
faster than trying to do it on your own
and yeah you can probably go find all
the information on my youtube channel
and if you do awesome please comment
below and let me know what's most
helpful
utilizing the resources from a business
coach can help you get there even faster
and help more people on the way
if i had a business coach in the
beginning that helped me
charge what i know how to charge now it
helped me sell physical therapy the way
i sell it now
i would have an extra million dollars in
the bank and i was actually going back
and talking to
derek i mentioned derek earlier about
this and he was like no don't even
calculate it and i calculated
for the numbers of patients i saw in the
first seven years of my clinical
practice as a physical therapist not
when i was a massage therapist but as a
pt
if i charge from the beginning what i
charge now i would have an extra million
dollars
i'll tell you this as a massage
therapist i was charging 85 dollars an
hour
and people didn't hesitate to pay it but
when i became a pt
everyone was like no one's gonna pay
more than their copay for pt so that
kept me from
charging what i was actually worth
because i had a business coach who
helped me get started
but he didn't insist that i charge more
it was not part of that conversation and
not part of that coaching program
unfortunately if i went back to do that
myself and that's what i do with my
platinum mastermind members the first
thing that we do
is i take them through my program
ethical influence which teaches them how
to charge what they're worth and enroll
people in plans of care
without them hesitating or feeling like
sleazy car salesmen so
charge what you're worth go all in get
the coaching and get the road map that
you need so you can make it better and
take it to the next level because i
never drive from
greensboro to poughkeepsie without
opening google maps
and the roadmap is exactly what you need
and
that's what people find in my program
the cash pd blueprint the blueprint
helps you get to
generating five to ten thousand dollars
a month so that once you get to that
level then you can enroll in our
platinum mastermind program
so i can help you go from 5 10 15 20 to
30 40 50 even 65 000 a month
and scaling a second location like ben
baggie who's one of my
most recent mastermind members to scale
that quickly um he did
went from 20 to 22 000 a month to
32 000 in the first month by changing
some pricing and sales structures and
then after a month eight he was at 65
000 a month
and moving out of town to go open a
second location
during the pandemic so check your ego
like you're smart enough but go all in
on your business education just as much
as you did on your clinical education
