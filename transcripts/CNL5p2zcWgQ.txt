secret number one
i can help more patients get better
faster and make plenty of money
if we cut insurance companies out of the
picture altogether just imagine this
patient knows what you do they say hey
erin
my back hurts can you help me yes and
they come in they do everything you say
and they get better and they're like wow
you're amazing
this is great i don't know what you did
it was magic but the last eight weeks
have been the best weeks of my life i
feel better now than i ever have before
you know i do my hope i do my exercises
twice a day
i do what you told me when you tell me i
mean wouldn't that be awesome
wouldn't it be great if you had patients
like that every day to work with
you know what if you do what's right for
your patients
the money is going to follow the
business is going to follow this is my
dad
my dad is you know one of those old
school physicians he's a cardiologist
and he's always said do what's right for
your patients his mentor eugene stead
you know like wrote the book on being
there for your patients and
if you take a good history your patients
will tell you what's wrong with them you
know i think a big
a big thing that we miss nowadays is
insurance
drives the process so much that we end
up without even knowing it
changing the way we practice based on
how we're going to get reimbursed
so one of the reasons i started a cash
practice because i knew
that i could do exactly what's right for
my patients
if my income was not tied to insurance
or a referral source so i know that if i
disagree with
someone else in town about a patient's
plan of care
and i tell the patient that it's not
going to hurt my business or my
livelihood
my employee's livelihood or my family
and i know that i'm doing what i believe
is right for my patients
it's one of those things that's
entrenched in me as a young as a young
kid and it's
what i believe and it's why i believe
that one of the big reasons that i'm
successful is because we just do what's
right for our patients
i have no pressure to treat patients a
certain way i have
no pressure to see them for x amount of
visits or less visits or whatever
it's do what the patients want we find
out what patients really want and i give
them a plan to get there
so i also believe it's inherent conflict
of interest in you know to
the whole insurance thing because my
goal as a physical therapist is to
help my patients get better the patient
in an insurance
environment isn't paying the bill well
they are paying the bill but not at that
moment they believe their insurance
company is going to pay the bill the
insurance company's
best interest is to pay the least amount
possible because they want their they
want to retain all their
earnings so their stock price rises and
the shareholders are happy
so the insurance company doesn't want to
pay for the patients i recommend
something the patient goes well i can't
do that because insurance isn't going to
pay
you know what it's an inherent conflict
of interest and
it's so confusing as you know people
excuse me are not aware of how much they
actually going to owe at the end of
their course of care i mean it's just
like it's a mess
and i believe this whole thing clean you
know cleans it up referrals from
physicians you know what
i'm not saying physicians are bad or
physicians you know we shouldn't
you know collaborate with physicians
what i'm saying is
we don't need to rely on another
profession or other professionals or
other providers for our livelihood when
you have
three referral sources who refer 70
of your business your livelihood can
swing
really you know left or right and a lot
of times it'll swing downwards
because one person disagrees with you
moves out of town
gets their practice is purchased by the
hospital you know or something
like you can lose 30 of your income all
of a sudden and that's
a very vulnerable place to be and
they're also not that great
you know when a physician refers
patients to us it's usually out of
convenience of location or the patients
don't really understand what they're
getting or where they're going and they
come and see us and we talk about what
their investment will be for their plan
of care and
and they're comparing it to the 35 copay
or even 15
copay they just paid to see their
physician who they deem as like
you know white coat god and you know why
am i paying
five times as much to come see you as a
physical therapist my physician told me
i need pt
and in that case they're paying five
times as much for a
modality than they are for the decision
maker so when referrals from physicians
people aren't coming to us for the
decision makers as decision makers
i want to treat motivated patients i
want people to be in my clinic who want
to be here
and how do i do that i like market
directly to patients and patients want
to be here and they come in and they're
motivated and they do their work
i believe the patients in this
relationship choose to be
here and so they are motivated and they
also have skin in the game
when you put skin in the game you're
going to do the work
and many people have high deductibles
and high co-pays or
you know recently co-pays are lower but
deductibles are even higher
it's crazy i mean it ends up being cash
anyways for a lot of people
and where do i believe i can serve them
the best is in our business in our
business model
because do you really want jennifer in
iowa making decisions on how your
patient gets treated
i mean like i don't you know someone
who's not a healthcare provider should
not be deciding whether my patient
gets a treatment or not or they get
reimbursed for treatment or not i just
think that that's uh it's it's a little
insane to me so let me share a story
with you about one of my patients jim
and jim came to see us but before he
came to see us
he went to see his primary care
physician because he had back pain
primary care physician gave him some
medication
sent him for an mri and he ended up with
the same pain
no relief a month later
he was still hurting so he went back to
his primary md
with more medicaid he got more meds and
the same results
he did a little searching online found
us through one of our blog posts
gave us a call and he's like dr bauer
answered his own phone
i mean i did at the time i was the one
working here i answered my phone
four treatments five weeks later he
feels great you know i mean it's
it's why you know he's wasted two months
of his time
and we could have he could have been
much better off if he knew about us
sooner or the physician said hey look
you know before we do meds in an mri
let's go get you some pt
like maybe it would he wouldn't have
come to see me um with what i just told
you but maybe he would
he should so this is the thing it's like
i want patients to come see us
first and the only way we can do that is
to
market directly to them and the only way
that i'm going to help 100 million
people is to teach you guys how to
how to do this so i work for patients
not insurance companies i am cash bt
if you are cash bt write in i am cash bt
because
i believe that together
we can make a huge impact in the world i
believe
if we do what's right for our patients
we're going to be we're going to reap
the reward
that we all deserve i mean because we've
all worked hard
everyone works hard you work hard you
transform people's lives
you should be able to take a day off of
work a week and go on vacation
spend some time with your family work
out every day
