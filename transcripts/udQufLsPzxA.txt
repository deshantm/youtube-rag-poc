and the secret to selling physical
therapy is not to actually sell anything
at all
[Music]
and today i'm gonna do is talk to you
about sales
sales the dirty word s-a-l-e-s it's a
five-letter word
most physical therapists struggle with
this one so right now more than ever you
need to actually learn how to sell
because you need to take advantage of
the opportunity
people the few people are giving you
that are calling you right now because
it wasn't coveted
you'd have another probably 40 50 100
more people calling you so right now you
can do all you want marketing
but people's attitudes and beliefs
are going to be skewed because of the
election because of the coronavirus
because of the whole uncertainty that's
coming along
but the few people that you do get in
through the marketing strategies you are
using
you need to be able to confidently sit
down with them and enroll them in your
plan of care the whole thing about sales
is that the way to sell is to not
sell anything it's to actually
um ask them questions you got to ask the
right questions
you got to find out their why you're
going to find out really like why is
that why
why and why like at least like the five
or seven y's
try to get the seven y's and if you can
figure out what it is they really want
what are they really afraid of
and you know you can help them do that
like
i want to be able to play tennis again
so i feel strong and healthy and a good
role model for my kids
i want to be able to run five days a
week without worrying about knee pain
so that i can reduce stress and
not gain the covert 19 and feel
confident about my body so i can be a
good role model for my daughter
oh great i can help you feel confident
about your body and be a good role model
for your daughter because
i can actually help you get back to
running but what they don't want is a
fix for their knee pain they want to
feel strong confident
and stress-free because sales is the
most ethical process you could
ever learn because by learning it you'll
understand it's just a process to find
out exactly what your patients and
clients truly want once you understand
what they truly want and you can spend
time with them finding out like
sometimes it takes more than 20 minutes
that's the beauty of being in a cash
practice is i've got all the time in the
world to sit down with this one person
and find out what they need
once i find out what they need and what
they want i will sell them what they
want and give them what they need
so once i know what they want and need
then and only then you can help them
solve if you know you can help them
solve your
the problem then it's your ethical
obligation to make them an
offer to work with you and don't
shortchange yourself
don't be like oh it's 75 an hour where
it's only 125
a visit don't shortchange yourself a
life-changing transformation if you find
out what that is
that's worth easily thousand dollars
don't put your
money to your time let money to time be
just what shows up on the super build
figure out like if i can give you a
life-changing transformation
wouldn't that be worth two thousand
dollars i mean look if i could help you
build a six-figure cash practice isn't
that worth
twenty five hundred dollars like you pay
me 2500 and i give you all the tools and
systems you need to generate hundreds of
thousands dollars a year every year for
the next 20 years
like that's pretty fair trade so and we
do that with
uh physical therapy as well you can't
put a monetary value
on confidence and being a good role
model for my kids or
being able to have sex with my partner
because it doesn't hurt
or it doesn't hurt like it used to right
or being able to
go to the gym or go run without fear of
like leaking or having to wear a pad i
mean pelvic pt
uh problems relate so
strongly to like where they called like
uh the daily daily life like essential
daily life
activities it's to me it's one of the
easiest ways to sell pt
it's harder when you've got someone who
like i just only hurt when i go to
crossfit
you know i pay 180 bucks to crossfit i
don't really want to pay anything else
can't you just meet on my deltoid
because i saw
i saw someone doing that on youtube
can't you just do that
like don't get into that game you can
in should figure out why that's so
important to them
that takes a lot a little bit longer of
a conversation sometimes and then you
should be
offering them physical therapy at a high
ticket
because it is it is a high ticket and
it's high tickets not 75 dollars
an hour it's not 150 an hour it's
1500 to solve your problem or 2 500 to
solve your problem or 1998
and i'm going to help you do all these
things and then you know okay look mrs
jones that's going to take about three
months i'm going to see about once a
week
or shoot if you have an eight post acl
patient you know that's going to take
you a year
like why not pitch them to 15 000
program
i mean i got to see you some weeks i go
see three times a week some weeks you're
just gonna be coming into my gym five
days a week sometimes i'm only be seeing
once every two weeks
but this process is going to take 12 to
18 months and you have to pass these
tests before you finish
and if you'd like to save some money we
can go ahead and uh you can pay up front
or
do care credit and it's you know 15 000
or you know i mean that's like
1500 a month for a year that's a great
deal so maybe it's even more than that
here's what i want you to do right now
is i want you to start asking
deeper questions to your patients and i
want you to start offering them
the plan of care that you know they need
and
ask for money in exchange for the plan
of care and results
