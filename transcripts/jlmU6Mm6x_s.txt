you are going to get what you want
as long as you're willing to put in the
work and let him guide you
you'll achieve all the goals and even
probably much
more than you ever thought
hi i'm dr alexis sams owner and lead
physical therapist
at az dance medicine specialist in
phoenix arizona
before joining erin's mastermind group i
was
really not completely focused on my
business
i was working full time as a home health
therapist it was a really good job
actually i was making like six figures
and i was afraid to take that leap into
starting my own business
i started working with erin in his
coaching program because i
followed him for the last couple of
years in social media
and i've always really enjoyed his
content
and everything that he had to say really
resonated with me
in terms of taking that next step to
really starting my own cash-based
business
after talking to him personally and then
doing a sit-in at his mastermind group
he definitely let me know that i had the
skills
i had what it took to grow and
nourish a successful business and he had
the tools the systems
and the experience to help me kind of
get there and help me to grow even more
when i kind of hit my little stumbling
blocks
working with erin has simply been
just life-changing like in so many ways
in such a short amount of time i never
would have dreamed
that my business would have grown to
what it is now working with aaron gave
me
the ability not just to dream my
business
but to actually like realize the vision
that i have
is actually attainable it's actually
doable
i've got a staff now i'm in a space
three times larger than when i started
and i've barely been working with him
just a little over a year
i never would have dreamed that my
business
would have grown to what it is now it's
not this far
off in the distant dream that i i'm
hoping may come true
it's already coming true and i'm already
laying the groundwork to
making it come true and that is solely
based on the work that i've done with
aaron
just building systems connecting and
networking with
other people who can help me along the
way as well
but always knowing that i can come back
to his resources
and him personally to answer my
questions
get me over my challenges and my
obstacles and just keep be moving
forward
it's just wonderful what's so different
about working with aaron
yes he presents and gives us the best
systems
to help our businesses grow and flourish
but it's the way that he does it
number one he just really i know 100
that he cares about me and cares about
my business growth
and it allows me to work with him
just with a hundred percent complete
trust just knowing that he's invested
in helping me succeed he's willing to
give
all of his resources everything that's
available online
everything that's available in our
mastermind meetings
all of that he freely gives to us he's
always available for extra encouragement
and i think that's what you're not going
to get from any other coaching or
mastermind program
really structured systems systems that
are continuing to grow and develop and
then just somebody who has your back 100
so what i recommend aaron's coaching
program
a hundred percent it's a lot of work
but he's with you a hundred percent of
the time
to guide you every step of the way to
get you the success that you want
for your own business hands down no
hesitation
highly recommend it
