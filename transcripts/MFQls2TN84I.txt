this is funny this is like a hilarious
like ranting podcast erson and aaron
rant about why they don't take hmos
there hasn't been a time in my life when
i've felt older
you know i feel really good i can get on
something a kettlebell and do some crazy
 with my shoulders i never used to
do and then like
there are days where i'm just like
dude is this really what it's like you
know you just like
get hit by hit by things you don't
expect oh what do you now
47. oh i'm still yeah i didn't know you
dude when i graduated pt school
uh united healthcare was like we're
gonna in north carolina we're gonna pay
you 38 dollars a patient no matter what
you do and and i was like we're gonna
pay you 42 dollars a patient no matter
what you do or how much time you sound
like there's no way yeah that's
that's still i think that average is
still probably higher than buffalo i
mean back when i was taking
hmo based patients
some are like blue cross blue shield was
something like 25
to 30 a visit
for for a visit and a valve might have
been a little bit more you know and then
but i think on average like when you
factor everything in including a vows
the average was 37.50
i know you're supposed to do
well the crazy thing is i i still don't
get it right like
i we say we just gotta we just got a
speech bill from it's like 300 our
insurance pays 50. we have to pay the
rest right how can people have to pay
the rest for pt yeah right you know like
why does our contract say that
we get reimbursed
whatever we agree to
and there's no one pays a difference you
know that's ridiculous every other
provider that you the patient pays a
difference we're just like yeah i'll
accept 35
for a 200 bill is that in the contract
or because they must be talking about
like they did balance billing but
instead of balanced billing they would
try to say hey here's what it's going to
cost up front and get the patient to pay
up front instead of
billing them on the end i think a lot of
people either i don't know if it's in
the contract because they've never read
one or is it or people just like they
don't even want to do the balance but
like build no balance
i mean
it's not that hard to do the balance
especially if you have some sort of
billing agency right like someone should
just be able to figure it out what
you're what the balance is and then the
patients
it must be the contract that says if
you're a par provider you get this
and that's it
and the patient is not responsible for
anything more than their copay the
patient's responsible for the copay and
then we'll reimburse you it's not the
copay plus it's not the copay plus
because at least in new york yeah if
someone someone has a 45 to 60 copay
they're already paying more than what
the insurance reimburses us we don't get
both right and insurance still docks a
visit like they and they paid zero in a
patient paper insurance is like well
like
co-pays 50 the insurance like okay cool
we don't have to pay anything we'd have
to pay anything and they still they
still take a visit
right
this is funny this is like a hilarious
like ranting podcast erson and aaron
rant about why they don't take hmos
oh my god that's so nuts it is not
incredible by the way if we're recording
this for a podcast you're listening we
would love to know what's the up
situation what are your thoughts about
this and why do you still take insurance
right please comment below
oh my god
that's incredible i do have a client
it's funny i have a client in
um
san pedro in california which is uh i
think
i think it's near la or maybe it's south
maybe it's down anywhere but she's like
aaron why would i go cash we've got this
insurance company he's gonna pay us 175
dollars a visit no questions asked like
75 of their patients are through this um
like it's a it's a union or the union's
uh health insurance plan it's like yeah
no no way
yeah no need to do anything different i
was like that's great
yeah the only thing i think they could
probably stand to learn from something
like uri it's just better marketing
email marketing all that kind of stuff
you know
direct to patient marketing but i mean i
guess if you have contracts like that
you don't really need direct to patient
marketing well that's the thing i've
told people lately is it's the it's the
friction of doing business like i've got
a higher friction business okay so if
you can take strategies we use in a high
friction business into a lower friction
environment
right like if you take insurance it's
like okay great like that's the biggest
amount of friction we have the the the
objections are more like time probably
and i don't want to fix this i was
talking to these guys the other day uh
who do marketing for these massive
companies and they're asking me these
questions and like well it sounds like
the people you help have these like kind
of basic sales and marketing problems
i'm like yeah because no one teaches us
this stuff and he was like grilling me
on these questions like he's like what's
the biggest threat to pt industry is it
you know the economy i was like no it's
the insurance companies and medicare you
know that's what i see as like the big a
bigger threat because everyone needs
needs what we got but anyways i'm like
uh yeah this is the biggest threat i
mean especially medicare it's like man
the hoops you have to go through to get
reimbursed and anytime you get audited
you're gonna get you're gonna fail
anyway because the auditing company is
funded by audits they're not even funded
by taxpayer dollars they're funded by
audits you know like that is nuts in
itself i know it's ridiculous
