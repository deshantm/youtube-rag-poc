if you can sell this on instagram that's
one thing if you can sell an email it's
another selling it on webinar is the
third way to do it
you want to use your webinar to build
your email list if you could just do a
webinar
and you could just pull a ton of people
off of instagram on your email list the
majority of my email list is from
running web using webinars as lead
magnet only advertise your webinar once
you can do it and it then you convert
don't do it organic the first you know
three to five times until you feel like
oh this is great i just converted a
really dope one and then you can look at
how do i do use advertisement uh to move
people to the webinar so you want to
start with your stack
right your offer stack it's 197 dollars
for your course what's the value of the
course
how much how much does it change
people's lives what would someone pay
for speech therapy out of pocket
you know that's not covered by the
school system to get these problems
solved a thousand bucks two thousand
dollars so a semester's worth of
physical therapy so the nominal price
the value is four thousand three hundred
and twenty dollars but you can get it
today for just
197 dollars so we start with the stack
you need bonus
bonus number one two and three okay and
these are the top three objections
like well do you have a downloadable
schedule for when to do x y and z do you
have the handouts for the exercise here
you get the you know like the tool kit
which is all the handouts it's like hey
if you get it on the webinar today
not only do you get the course and the
training on how to do this with your
child you get the pdf handouts and
worksheets
you get the uh
you get you get the instructors you're
like what about like you know maybe
there's the top three questions people
have about your course like why should
they do it now at the price you're
charging you might not be getting these
but you know it's what's the tangible
what's the tangible thing which is the
pdfs that's the tangible printable thing
there might be a bonus video like maybe
you can just create another like is
there a thing that's
it's not the fit it's not the
10th video in a series of nine it's
another video that complements a problem
that people have so these are your
bonuses your offer stack you're already
they get a membership a private
membership portal and maybe they have a
private facebook community
and they get lifetime access to that i
know you're all in on instagram but
maybe they get a facebook community
because they're all on facebook too and
that's where they can ask questions and
eventually they can ask you or
your team members questions you know if
you bring on other people to help do
stuff you know so they can get access to
that for life and your facebook
community just becomes another lead
magnet for you so you start with your
offer stack and so the total value
the total value
is should be
10x the price
so if the price is 200 the total value
should be at least 2 000 but if you're
like you get these things all these
handouts together that's worth you know
500 bucks and the facebook community is
invaluable and
this other thing uh this other training
to teach your
somebody else you know to help the
teachers or help the you know the
babysitter that's worth you know you
know five you know thousand dollars one
of the bonuses alone should be worth
more than the cost of admission so you
start with your offer stack and you
figure out the offer stack
and now we work backwards what are the
top
it's like the top three
problems or objections it's the
internal
reason that this won't work
it's the external reason and then it's
the vehicle the vehicle is your course
or product
so like click funnels
right
the vehicle is you need funnels the only
place to get it is click funnels that's
one thing and the external reason is
what other people won't let you do to
get this program so well uh they have
already have a speech therapist
they're already doing something in the
school
what is that excuse that someone else is
keeping them from moving into your
program and then the internal objection
i don't have enough time
yeah sometimes you know i have enough
time or i have five kids how am i going
to do this with five kids it's probably
a time thing not a money thing you know
external a money thing would be an
external objection
internal objection is you know like
what's inside of me that's going to keep
this from happening or i don't know i'm
just a i'm just a parent and i don't
know how to
take care of my kid all day long so now
once you know those things
now
now when you build out your webinar
you have like an intro
and a welcome
and then like a promise which is kind of
like your pre-frame the pitch that's one
of the shortest ways to do it you say
hey you're here and i'm going to do
everything i can in the time in the next
30 minutes 45 minutes to teach you these
these big things the promise the title
um if at the end uh what i'm going to do
is i've got a program that helps people
do x y and z um and if it's okay with
you i'll tell you i'm going to spend a
little few minutes at the end telling
you about the program and how you can
get on board with it so you you
pre-frame it and then
you
uh you teach the internal external
vehicle so these are the three secrets
you teach your your three like secrets
which are
the you know the internal
external
and the vehicle you teach them what to
want
using um
testimonials
and stories
and you so you build each section like
that and then um and then you have a and
then once you do that
you build those sections then you have
your at the end you have your pitch
so the way the pitch goes is you know
you have a transition one of the ones i
learned from padres is hey by the way
i've got this program it's called the
cash bd blueprint it gets these people
these results the other one is wouldn't
you say that this has been time well
spent um but even if we had all day i
couldn't teach you everything you need
to know so that's why i created my
program the cash pt blueprint it's for
these people and it does this if you
were to go get this from a local
therapist at the school you'd have to
wait a few weeks you have to fill out
the form you have to wait and get
approved and then it still costs you
about two thousand dollars um but in
this program we've helped i've helped
thousands of people get these results
and it's just 197 today when you enroll
on the webinar okay but that's not all
you're gonna get and then you introduce
each uh
of the bonuses every time you introduce
a bonus you tell them what they're gonna
get you tell them like course
price
bonus
price then it's the next bonus it's
course
bonus one bonus two
and then it's course
bonus like one two three you just keep
reminding them here's what here's what
it costs here's what you're gonna get
and that's how you roll out a stack so
by the end you've got the whole value
stack as soon as you start the pitch is
when you drop in a link for people to
register or go to it and then
when you make when you when you come in
and you stack it you say hey you just
enroll today
um
it's just gonna be this go to the link
you just tell people what to do you keep
repeating yourself in that space you can
answer any objections you know that
people have told you that you might have
or you might not be getting a lot of
objections and you know that's totally
cool hey you know what this may not be
for you and if you're at all hesitant to
do it like cool but i can i know if you
have a child with this problem and you
want this result this is the next best
step for you the other thing we do at
the end
is we i do a q a and so as part of the
promise you can stand at the end we'll
have a q a where you can ask me any
question about
the course and when i get there i i say
hey what question you have about the
course and whether it's right for you um
if you have a question about anything
else just drop it in the chat and i'll
do my best to get to it because if you
use this as an evergreen program you
don't want to say hey i'm going to do it
live or i'm going to get to all the
questions you just say i'm going to do
my best to get all the questions and you
may get so many people on here that you
might be like holy cow there's i can
only answer you know a handful of these
questions yeah so between answering each
question
give another call to action to get the
course for everybody so answer a
question and then say hey if you're
still here that means you see the value
so what i want you to do is go ahead and
click on the link right now and enroll
and as soon as you enroll we'll get you
into our private group and get you the
training materials and so that we can
start helping your kids today or
tomorrow and then you just keep doing
that until like you're done and you're
satisfied and happy and you've answered
people's questions then i then i do a
follow-up but that's the main thing for
the webinar just consider the first
webinar is like
making sure the tech works the second
webinar is making sure that uh
you get some sales like your pitch your
pitch is right and the third webinar is
getting everything kind of together and
feeling like it flows somewhat and then
you take your best one and i would say
do it do it live
once you know
once a month or once a week depending
how much money you want to make right
i would do it live once a week
until you get one that just totally
smashes it if you do it that frequency
the first couple will be really big and
then they'll get smaller and smaller
but look for your conversion percentage
because if you turn it on evergreen i
make more on the evergreen version of
the webinar than i do on the live
