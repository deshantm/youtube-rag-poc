what's up it's aaron um let me make this
a little bigger hey so this is a
training on how to convert a webinar jam
live webinar into an evergreen
ever webinar
[Music]
[Applause]
my name is aaron lebauer and if you're
watching this on social media somewhere
this is exactly what you're going to
learn is how we take our live webinars
and turn them into evergreen webinars
we've made actually
more got more patients more money more
clients through evergreen webinars than
we do live live convert really well
and if you're watching this on youtube
somewhere be sure you hit the
the like subscribe and notification bell
or maybe it's the like button here
subscribe and the little notification so
you get access to more of those videos
um
if you're on my team because primarily
i'm making this for a team training is
this how we're going to take an
evergreen
a live webinar and turn into an
evergreen webinar inside web on our gym
so
let's um
let's get back to it we're going to log
into webinarjam so if you don't have
webinar jam and you're watching this
there should be a link below to get a
good deal on webinar jam through our
affiliate link if you're on my team and
you need access send me a message and
we'll make sure we get access through
lastpass
so log in
we're going to go in we've got two
options these are live webinars these
are evergreen webinars we can go
straight to
everwebinar
these are the evergreen webinars that we
have
we want to create add a webinar
and uh what what it does is every
webinar can create a webinar from a
previous live webinar so this is the
webinar that we're gonna um this was the
live one we're gonna make this evergreen
if you haven't done one live
um through webinar jam
um
you can still create a new ever webinar
but i recommend doing it live through
webinar jam first
prove that it works and then put it on
evergreen so here's how we're going to
do that we are going to
do add a webinar
and i'm going to use a previous webinar
jam live session i'm going to go here
and choose it the telehealth
no it's not that one it's at the bottom
the
labour pt back pain webinar select the
session
and go up and confirm and what it's
going to do is it's going to load in all
of the registration details registration
page
all the comments and all the things the
only thing it doesn't load in are some
of the integrate well it does an
integration we have to update some of
the integrations but
i'll show you that in a second confirm
there's a couple things it doesn't load
in but um it loads in 90 of it so now
basic settings
okay um so the webinar name isn't uh
back pain is a tvd webinar i'm gonna
just call this like
um
this is private this is for us ever
ever webinar
um that's the august one here's the
webinar title this is public facing
this is public facing don't list your
webinar like this is on
the webinar jams thing i don't ever list
it because it doesn't ever get any um
any traffic i mean this is one that we
could list for other people because it's
about uh
back pain um
so
self-help personal finance money i mean
i
rarely do these and it's really not that
important health and beauty
so i just put don't list
and we have to click confirm after each
change webinar presenters just make sure
it's dr aaron lebauer
so that's fine
next schedules not configured so we have
to create a schedule for this webinar so
what i'm going to do is i did this on a
tuesday
at 6 00 p.m so what i'm going to do is
i'm going to make this just available
every
day
um at 6 00 pm actually every
you know let's just call this every day
at 6 pm
add
and then enable instant watch
or late attendance we're not going to do
that or just in time so this means they
can see hey watch the replay now
and this is enabled just in time so the
enable just in time is
is great because people always feel like
it's live
more people attend the replays than the
lives but more people will convert from
a live session so next available session
every 15 minutes
um
hide night time schedules is on so if
someone's browsing late at night like
why would i be live late at night
so i would make this like 10 p.m um to 7
00 a.m so any time between 10 p.m and 7
a.m it'll feel like hey the next webinar
is coming up
display the next three immediate ones so
it'll be like
you know so what this will show is it'll
show just in time webinar starting in 15
minutes it'll show tonight at six and
then tomorrow at six
um
you can block days you can block
holidays i i don't know why they have it
i don't have it on here but i always
block july 4th
because that's um
oops
that is a
national holiday in the united states
for some reason
you gotta go forward to july
but it won't let me somehow won't let me
do it
july
why won't it let me add july 4th
august
july 4th maybe you have to go backwards
and you can block any day there we have
to in order to go forward i have to
click confirm
and then we go to registration page
design
really not going to change anything
about these
you can see this is what it is it worked
really well
i'm not going to change anything just
make sure that this doesn't say
live so i can search to make sure like
this doesn't say live on it and it
doesn't
so there's nothing i'm going to change
here
i'm just going to cancel on edit exit
confirm registration form design we have
to change that we have to change these
fields free to register password we
don't have to change anything here we
just have to kind of click through it
notifications
um okay this is where you can choose
ever webinar notification or your own
autoresponder gateway
like for right now
for the clinic stuff it's every webinar
if you're watching this and you're on my
team and you are
reproducing a um
like doing an evergreen webinar from a
consulting business uh whoever webinar
we would choose this one
it's set up to send from aaron at labour
consulting but right now
through the clinic i don't want clinic
people getting aaron at labour
consulting messages so we're just going
to keep it in the ever webinar mail
because it'll it'll still show it's from
me it but it just comes from a different
uh server not our not our own
um
but if it is like a cache pd blueprint
webinar uh new patients or profits
webinar and we're making evergreen
choose the um your own smtp gateway but
for the clinic ones we'll just continue
to use every webinar mail unless i
figure out that we can do two different
ones
reminder notifications
these are you see how it'll still be
sent from
um dr aaron labaur at webinar info
if i chose my
own
it it's from lebauer consulting but
that's why i don't want my clinic uh
people to see lebar consulting they
should see lebar pt but i think we can
only have one of these here and we run
more people
through um not through the clinic but
through
yeah through the consulting so we'll
just leave that
all these things we don't really need to
change them at all
this is what goes out to people
um because i set it up on the live it's
all
um pretty much set it's um like there's
nothing that we have to change here
unless we want to change anything but we
don't
which is kind of cool
it's going to be really quick
integrations
this is something that we do need to
update
so with campaign or pt email engine
we you see how it's like webinar live
miss scheduled so there's um ever
webinar tags so i will open up another
um
let me open up another page here
okay so you just open up uh
our active campaign or pt email engine
account um and we're gonna
run through and i'm gonna find uh the
automation i'll show you guys how
to know exactly which
tags but you don't have to actually open
this up i'll show you the tags or tags
already in but i just want to show like
why
and
let's see you can see we've got
the bauer pt every webinar um le bauer
pt
webinar follow-up
um
there's a webinar welcome
so you can see that i have these
triggered
using this lebowrpt everwebinar tag
so what we have to do here in
activecampaign then is you don't have to
open up pt email engine or active
campaign at all we just have to
integrate with it
so if they register
we need to go over here and click add
tag
and it needs to be
we
unfortunately can't search we have to
scroll
it needs to be labour
pt
ever webinar and create integration rule
so i have to replace each of these so
you'll see like if it's in the
consulting business
it should be
very similar where it says uh
um launch webinar
live it would the alternate tag will be
launched web ever webinar live
so
we just have to update these so you may
have to go into our pt email engine
account to um
just verify the correct tags um this is
the most complicated part here so i've
recreated this one i'm going to recreate
this one if they attended the
live webinar
and add a tag
i'm going to go down to levauer
pt every webinar i'm going to do this
for each one
of our pt
ever webinar live okay everywhere create
the integration rule
the bauer pt
mist
so it's add tag
the bauer pt
ever webinar mist
of our pt every webinar missed
create integration rule
in the next one labaur
pt
um
well this is the next one in this is
evernote webinar replay so
um
the bauer pt
ever webinar replay so what these do is
these trigger different emails in the
back end of our system
the power pt
ever webinar replay missed live
um
the bauer pt webinar scheduled
when they purchased our products so this
is um something that'll trigger just to
know that they've actually for this one
they've either purchased product or they
got on the call
so i need to add
if they purchase your product
and
tag uh we're gonna go down here
about rpt ever webinar
and i'm
maybe don't have that um
as a uh
as a tag so i'll show you how we're
going to fix that
so it's the i can kind of copy and paste
this one with our pt
copy i can go over into pt email engine
or active campaign
go to contacts
click on manage tags
and then i can paste this in but i don't
want webinar i wanted to say ever
webinar scheduled
ad tags
and really this is just a tracking one
for me um
and it doesn't always
this part doesn't always work
why does it seem like that's not working
either
there we go let's see
i think it's just a delay here
okay i just internet stopped being
delayed i'm just going to copy this
paste it here
type in scheduled
add tags
now that just did what it's supposed to
do
so now i can go back to
webinar jam and it's not going to be
here right away
it won't be here if i have to go add a
tag
with our pt ever webinar it's not there
so what i have to do is i have to click
on ok i have to click confirm
and then to open it back up again
click on edit and then i can go to if
they purchased
add tag
and then we'll scroll down
bower pt ever webinar
it's still not there yet
see there's the webinar everywhere i'm
trying to click okay confirm and
we can just refresh the page it may just
need to it needs to refresh the
integration
so i'll go back in here
oops that one's confirmed i need to go
to next
next oh because i hadn't done the whole
thing um there we go now on the
integrations click back on edit
see i still got something these ever
webinar ones and i'm going to
they purchased
add tag
now you see how it refreshed everything
well now rpt every webinar scheduled
create integration rule
so good scheduled i need the left early
i think i need the
every webinar we got liveness scheduled
left early replay so there's a left
early so if they leave before
and we're gonna choose like one hour
and zero minutes
generally
when we do a we start pitching about 45
minutes in so we could even say if they
left before
45 minutes
um we're going to add the tag
lebowrpd every webinar left early
whatever webinar
launch automation
oh and i don't have it either so once
we're gonna go back over here
um
and then we're just gonna
do this copy paste
left
early
add tags
all right there we go
so we just have to go in here click ok
confirm
and then i'm going to go back in and see
if i can get this to
if they
leave before
0 0
45
and tag i don't think it's going to do
it i think we have to go back out again
yep
confirm
and then let me just refresh again
okay right here
here
and go
there
and go back to integrations
and now we can go in here
and say
if they leave before 0
45
let's add this tag
there it refreshed and now we go to
the bauer pt ever webinar left early
and create the integration rule okay now
we've got it um so now we have to delete
these regular webinar ones
so we have to say delete
webinar live every webinar
live so we can delete that one
webinar missed ever webinar
i don't have an oh there it is every
webinar missed so i'm going to delete
that one
webinar scheduled
ever webinar scheduled
about tv webinar left early every
webinar left early delete webinar replay
ever webinar replay so i'm going to
delete the webinar ones
and now i'm left with these integrations
i'm going to click ok and confirm and
that's it and sometimes there's some
third-party tracking
which might be google analytics facebook
ad tracking etc we don't have it set up
for this one
um
but if there is we just need to that
should copy over if it doesn't you can
go to a
go back to the webinar jam
version of this and copy and paste that
over
and then we go to thank you which is a
built-in template for a lot of ours
there'll be a custom page and it should
just pull the custom page right over a
clickfunnels page
um
survey your registrants so that's
enabled
so you just leave that
thank you page template like there's
really nothing to change on these
because it's all customized
like through code here
it's just
this whole this isn't editable because
it'll
just pre-fill in what they're doing so
you just make sure there's nothing on
here that says live and there's not
live there's nothing on here that says
live so it doesn't really
matter so cancel and exit
um
and then here's the
like live
uh the simulated live um information
so there's a couple things that we do
want to update um
we don't need to update the countdown
page webinar room the polls and quizzes
so sometimes
how often you're exercising right now
these are fine
they will
um
sometimes it all if i have a uh
highlighted announcements or
um
that will be up for the whole time i
think i have like a
in the live chat box these are it pulls
in everyone's um
chat questions
but sometimes there are
i think the
sticky messages so like this is a sticky
message i put on at the beginning
sometimes i'll i'll forget to turn this
off and it'll stay on for like an hour
but it's like hi welcome to the workshop
so if we wanted to change it and just
have that for the first 10 minutes
instead of 16
what we do is we highlight this
copy you paste it in there
and we do start time you just leave it
at zero end time you know it doesn't
need to be 16 minutes we could just put
you know 12 minutes and then 12 you know
24 seconds and then we can add it
and then we have to go and delete this
one
16 minutes wasn't too long but sometimes
i'll forget and it'll be up there for
the whole hour
um so we just need to double check that
one
display number of attendees we want to
choose dynamic attendees and we can put
max at like 55 people
confirm
depending on how many people join the
webinar i would basically just set it at
the number that's a little bit higher
than the people that uh
registered for the webinar um
variable attendees
live sales notifications sometimes
they'll be live sales notifications
it'll pull through sometimes they're not
that's not something if it doesn't pull
them through
no big deals because the tracking is
really difficult to get it to work all
the time because people's phones and all
that stuff doesn't really track
purchases or schedules from phones i
don't have any file handouts
on this one
redirects sometimes there'll be two of
them in here but
just redirects people at the very end
and highlighted announcements
um this is good you could look through
the chat and sometimes just make sure
there's nothing in here that like
is inappropriate or that people are
saying hey i can't blah blah blah like
this is terrible
you know you should you should never say
that and it happens more in the
consulting stuff and we can delete those
if they don't look right but there's
nothing in here that's um
that's uh
inappropriate or anything like that it's
live sales notifications we click next
webinar replay recording enabled no
expiration date if there is an
expiration date that i set that'll come
forward allow users submit questions to
the questions
we need to make sure this goes to the
correct email i don't want to come to my
personal email and the reason that's in
there is because that has um
that that that's how i signed up and so
that's the uh
the email
that uh they put in here
aaron at so this should be aaron
atlabauerpt.com
um if it's a consulting uh webinar we're
gonna put aaron of our consultant right
there
and then we're gonna put uh confirm
allow users submit questions
webinar replay recording
let's see
simulated let me go back here
countdown page live chat box
sticky messages
well users submit questions the chat box
will be disabled so replay visitors not
be able to submit their questions i'm
let's do disabled questions
um
we're going to do disable questions
and then we're going to finish
and then it's ready
and now
now what we have to do
there's two other things to do
is um
these are advanced so that's the basic
version the advanced version and there's
two things to do here
number one
is to take this um
code
and put this on the thank you page
um
for after people schedule or
buy so this code goes on the thank you
page we have to enter in like a price if
it's a call i generally enter in a one
but a lot of times that tracking doesn't
really work so
it doesn't work reliably
um as many times as i've done it i
can't get to do work reliably but it
does work it just not all the time and i
think a big part of it is because people
are doing it from their phones these
days
and it won't fire the same code
um so that's one advanced step and
that's
where you you just copy this and you go
paste it and we have to put it in the
body tag so
depending on where
the thank you page is
or the next page after
they
buy or schedule then this code needs to
be placed in the body tags on that page
the other advanced thing to do would be
to
to make it feel like it's even more
simulated in live
what we can do remember here the source
video um was a previous webinar jam
session i can download this video and
host it on amazon s3
and put it the link to the external file
here
but because i imported a previous
webinar jam session it imported all the
settings
and then when i'm done i can go back in
and i can put a link to
the um
i'm just going to cancel that uh i can
go put a link to the uh
to the
video
and you can host it in a couple
different places but amazon s3 and we
have an amazon s3 account um
for instance
i believe
i'm not sure if we're doing it on this
webinar or not i think so let's see yeah
so here it is so it's um just hosted and
the difference is is it makes it so you
can't pause the video on the replay or
at least it used to
but you can use here you can use mp4 you
oh now you can do youtube videos in
vimeo pro
i'm using mp4 hosted somewhere else
because i don't want it to show up as a
youtube video or vimeo pro um so that's
why we're doing it on amazon
s3
so the way to do that is we gotta go
over to webinar jam
we go to the
prior webinar we go to your links
and i'm going to go to replay
i'm going to choose the session
and then here's my download button
here's this is the replay page but this
is the download replay video
and i'm going to put it on my
desktop and i'm going to say labour
physical
therapy
i'm going to actually name it something
i want people to see
um
so i'm going to say fix
your
back pain in three easy steps
labour physical therapy
um
online
workshop
and then i just save it
and while it's saving i'm going to open
another browser window i'm gonna go to
amazon
s3
now if you're working for me you may
need me to do this part because i don't
know how to share i haven't set up
access to this for other people in our
organization quite yet but you go to
sign into console
i'm sure there's a way to do that and i
can figure it out
and it's probably the difference between
these two things so i'm a root user
and this is probably we just have to set
you up as this
and then we're going to type in the
character scene on the image below
gosh i can't tell what that is
d h rfswdh like that
password
and that didn't like it my password's
incorrect
it just autofilled the wrong password
there we go
okay
now i need to go in so amazon is a lot
of services
okay
um we need to
contribute i don't need to do any of
these things
um recently visited
all services
here it is i need to go to storage s3
storage there's so many things to do in
here
and then we're going to go to
the healthy just ever webinars labour
so we're gonna we'll choose this one
every webinar is a blower if you're
doing uh
these are other backup folders labour
consulting ever webinars
you know um
yep every webinar click that
and i'm going to upload my video
and i have to add the file
i'm going to go to desktop here it is
click open
all right and then i have to set up my
permissions
it needs to be
granted public
access even though
there's a thing it's like people need to
be able to public musical to see this
otherwise it won't work this is the
storage class nothing needs to change
there
permissions
um let's see
yep and then click upload
and it's going to upload
upload status so i'm going to pause this
video until it uploads
all right there we go
file uploaded okay so now what we do
is i click down here
all right here is the url i have to copy
this url some right click
copy
i want to open it let's say open a new
incognito window and just make sure that
it works
and there it's playing
okay
so that's all i need to do i can close
that and i can go back to webinar jam
go into every webinar
go back to edit
source video
external video i'm going to paste in my
url the other thing i have to do is i
have to
know exactly how long this video is
so
it's 109 28 so i need to come in here
pause that i need to come in here and
put it in as one hour
009 minutes
28 seconds because that way webinar jam
will know exactly how long to play this
video
and i confirm
and now i can go all right it's a minute
1 hour and 9 minutes and 20 seconds
remember
when we added that tag that was like if
they left early before the offer so
that's where i might need to come back
in
and update
you know if they left early so 45
minutes for this one's fine um i have uh
for a couple of webinars
especially the ones uh
i do often i'll have an email goes out
to people they leave early say hey what
happened here's a link to get back into
the webinar and that's where that's
important but we don't need to change
that now
and now the ever webinar is set the next
thing we have to do is take the
registration link
copy it
and update our pretty links so i believe
in
the bauer pt blog.com
i think we have a webinar pretty link in
uh for consulting
for all of our consulting we have a um
some pretty links and we just need to
update the pre-links
so i believe let's see if this one
we have a webinar pretty link here
and it's waiting a little waiting okay
let's see free workshop for social media
mobility for strength
the bauer pt free online workshop i
believe this is it
so pain relief workshops what i'm going
to do is i'm just going to copy this and
paste and just verify
yep this is going to the old one see
that's expired or that was the live one
that we did so i need to go back to
webinar jam i'm going to take this guy
copy it
and go back in here um
there's this free online workshop and
i'm going to do edit
and then i'm going to
paste
and update
and then double check and it may be that
you just come up here you put in webinar
so in the consulting there'll be one or
two it's the free webinar or launch
webinar here
web
venar
um free online workshop free online
workshop
free pain workshop so we just need to
for social media promo
so i just had two different links
i need to update that
and boom
now they're updated and now it's an
evergreen webinar and it should update
any of the links in our um
automations to get people into the
webinar because we use these pretty
links in there
and then that's all that we need to do
to convert a webinar jam live webinar
into an evergreen ever
webinar you will want to make sure that
you have um
an email automation account where you
can send
people uh automatically into a launch
sequence so you can see here we have an
ever webinar launch sequence
um and i may or may not have activated
this but i'll show you that we've got
this is using pt email engine
and this link in here
for people to reserve their their spot
this should be
one of our
um
evergreen links but it's not
so this one
what i would do is i come back over
close that
i'm going to say
webinar
free online workshop so i'm going to
copy this
and it's likely that i was putting this
together and never
um
really uh
i don't think there's anyone in here i
never institute i never activated this
and started putting people through here
but these this is where those pretty
links um come in handy because i don't
have to update every email each time i
just have to update the pretty links
um
so i think i
didn't have this
updated because we weren't really using
it
these were some messages specific to the
pandemic and
um but that's how we do it and so those
if you if you use a pretty link or a
redirect in your email automations you
won't have to
use it in um you won't have to update
all your email links
so these all need to be updated
um and maybe i you know people have
moved through this because whatever but
you can see people aren't actively in
this one
they are actively in uh
let me show you um
here's a launch sequence uh blueprint
every webinar launch sequence this one
will have a bunch of people it's got
5000 people in there automation because
this is one of the ones i'm currently
running through the coaching business
um
oh and everyone's at the end so you know
this is one i i used to run through and
like we're not actually running them
through this now but there's someone
right there
um
so
uh you know it's very similar i'd have
to go back and
look we've got so many of them that uh
i don't know them all but that's really
uh what we have to do is we don't have
to update the links and all the emails
we can just update them through our
pretty link server in wordpress and that
should update everything over the email
side
and that's pretty much how you do it and
so now
these links are ready to
for us to promote on social media
through email hey go here and
watch the training
oh yeah i knew there'd be one or two
things that i forgot to do so here's
what i do want to do
and i have to go back and figure out
who it is that uh registered or paid but
when we do do these evergreen webinars i
do want to
um
well actually
i'm not going to do this for the bauer
pt webinar because this is one of those
ones where it's for the clinic and i
don't want everyone to know hey
so-and-so just registered for the thing
but for like the blueprint
and some of the other programs we will
take everyone that registered on the
webinar
and uh add them as like a
live sales notification so there's none
here
i don't really want that for the clinic
webinars
but let's just show you
for the blueprint one
what we've done
is um for anyone that wasn't tracked we
set up the
live sales notifications and so you just
put in the minute uh or approximate
minute or time and you can find that
through email or we just kind of start
putting them in there um in like
decently spaced um based on
when their notifications came in
um and you put in the the the hour the
time etc and you put in uh it'll say
josh just enrolled in the cash pd
blueprint and it'll put up these uh
notifications and so for the clinic
we're not going to do that because of
privacy um but for coaching business you
can come in and put these you just add
these in i just got to make sure it
lines up with a time in the webinar when
after we make the offer
and uh sometimes they don't get pulled
through from the live sometimes like i
said the uh tracking links don't work
but it's really cool once you get into
an evergreen webinar to give the people
these notifications that people have
enrolled in your program it's like
social proof that that's happened as a
webinar presenter i'll be calling it out
but that's just one other ninja trick
that ever webinar allows you to do so by
the way if you've got this far and uh
you're watching this and you're not on
my team and you want to get an
everwebinar webinar jam account
there's a link below that should give
you a
a discount
or a two-week free trial to ever webinar
and webinar jam
if you're trying to figure out how do i
set up and send out all these
follow-up emails i'd be happy to give
you um
what like
28 or 30 something emails a webinar
welcome sequence and a webinar follow-up
sequence
um so that you can plug in and integrate
with the your webinar jam into the pt
email engine and pd email engine runs on
the active campaign
platform and so by doing that we can
integrate them both
and so if you're interested in getting
all the emails written for you
and knowing exactly what to say it's pt
email engine.com just go to the link
below
what we'll do is we'll set up an account
for you
and waive the 500
setup fee write all your emails and hand
over an account that's ready to go um so
you can integrate it directly with
webinarjam and sell more
products and services and help thousands
of more people
doing online webinars
and uh send it by sending them fallout
messages so
