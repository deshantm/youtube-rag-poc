hey welcome back to the cash BG lunch
hour podcast
um I'm your host Aaron labauer if you
don't know me I'm six foot three I have
red hair and I'm from North Carolina and
today my special guest is Megan Stinson
she's also from the south from Tennessee
um just a short State over
um but not that close it's a decently
long drive but anyways we both got
plumbing and electricity in the last few
weeks
um Megan thank you so much for joining
us on the cash 50 lunch hour podcast
today
here Aaron yeah um here let me do the
thing it's awesome to have you so
um I think that uh there's a couple
unique things about you and what you've
done
um for the reason I wanted to have you
on the show I think uh let's see I'm
gonna review them and then I'll ask you
some questions but you used to have an
in-network practice
um you sold it shut it down and then was
like it then things didn't work because
what they sold it and then you're like I
got to get out of this and now you've
started a cash practice with your
partner Caitlin something like that
right yes yes that's about it that's
about it so let me go back and say
that's really kind of cool
when did you graduate PT school and when
you were in PT school did you know you
wanted to own a business or did did
something change along the way
so yeah I graduated in 2007 and
um my ideal situation was business
ownership I'm an entrepreneur by
character
um I like to look at the big picture and
I like to have the most recent impact so
I
didn't think there'd be a better way
than that than to try to I'm on practice
to treat patients the way I wanted to
wow so going into PT school had you
already owned a business before or
family had a business
no no not at all no
so completely prepared yeah you just
knew I got to own my own business what
where did that come from yeah
um like I said I think that um
I think part of it just stems from my
personality traits
um yeah and I'll be honest with you I
don't like to be told what to do I mean
that's a that's a fatal flaw sometimes
but you know um
over the years I've matured and I can
take constructive criticism now which
was a problem before but
um anyway but I just um
I knew that the impact I wanted to have
was not going to be possible if I was
working for someone else yeah yeah
right on was there a time when you
noticed that
like
um was it before you know what was it
yes so probably when I was in my
clinical rotations in PT school now
don't get me wrong I had an incredible
Mentor right out of PT school that I
worked for
um it was a small insurance-based
practice attached to hospital system
um but he ran things very differently
than the typical PT school rotations
that we went through but after going
through some of the larger chains and
going through some of the rehab
hospitals I knew I wanted to be
different before I graduated yeah right
on what was it that you saw that you
didn't like or that you thought you
could do differently
so um I don't like patients to be a
number because I truly love and
sincerely care for them and what they do
I don't like the feeling and I graduated
in animal science so when I say herding
cattle I actually know what that looks
like but I didn't want that to be
patient care for me or client care for
me I knew there had to be something
better and there had to be a better way
to do it than that the other thing that
I found
um and this was in PT school and then
owning the insurance in network-based
practice which I did because I knew
that's the only that's the only way I
thought I could do it at the time right
if your attention is divided between
four or five or six or eight different
you know people on your caseload you
can't give that one-on-one care that
they really deserve and they really need
yeah so so is it is it more like you
know I think my first thought was a lot
of people are like hey I saw five
shoulders today I'm like no you had five
people you know or people are asking
questions well I can't get my I can't
get the patient's knee covered by
insurance or we can only treat one body
part at a time I'm like but the body
parts didn't walk in a person walked in
right right so the person walked in and
that's what I tell people now in this
practice one of the reasons I love it so
much is because when they walk in the
door let's say I get to treat John Smith
um I'm not treating his meniscus tear
I'm treating John Smith right and you
know the biomechanics of the whole
person is what causes injury or issues
or perseverates those problems and if
you don't treat all of it then the
patient may get you know a hair better
or their meniscus might get better but
things are going to come right back so
they're not going to get the best care
right so I agree yes 100 yeah and so
um you graduated PT school did you open
your business right away
so Noah worked for a outpatient practice
that was attached to a acute care
setting in a rural place that had a
rehab hospital as well and so I worked
for them for about four years and then
had the opportunity to actually purchase
a practice in my hometown so the first
place I worked was about five hours from
home for me and we were looking for a
way to get back and um my mother's a PTA
and she had opened a practice with two
PTS
and they were ready to retire get out of
it do something different and so my
husband and I stepped into that practice
which unfortunately at the time was not
doing very well either and another one
of the large chains opened up at the
same time and so the practice was was in
pretty bad shape whenever I got there
yeah I wasn't smart enough to look at
the numbers as well though I know better
now
what
um what did you do I mean so then what
happened you did you figure out like
something uh that made it work or do you
got you said you I think you said you've
sold it like tell me a little bit about
what happened what was the journey what
was the easy part what was the hard part
sure so um
a lot of people don't understand
sometimes when you own a small business
in the wrong way you don't really own it
it owns you and that's what I found out
through that practice fortunately the
one we have here is not like that but
what we ended up doing was taking a huge
risk and I decided well we're either
going to have to close because I haven't
taken a paycheck for myself in two years
ate all my employees first didn't let
anybody go and decided I'm either gonna
have to close or we're going to have to
expand and take the risk somebody really
smart one time told me that when you
move to a new location people think you
know more and so we did um we expanded
probably three times our size
um as far as where we were took out a
business loan and a lot of credit
and then um expanded to the new location
which was huge did a lot of PR and a lot
of marketing and all of a sudden we
started growing and booming so at our
largest I had about 18 employees we were
a multi-disciplinary practice so we had
ptot speech massage therapists Fitness
classes
um you name it we pretty much had it in
this massive location yeah so what was
the problem
the problem there's a big problem yeah
um the problem was that I believed that
in order to maintain the growth in order
to maintain the business I had to be
there constantly and I was the only
person that could do it all I had a
really hard time letting go of control
to let my staff do their jobs after
eight years of this I ended up having
two strokes
because I was working so much I didn't
see my kids I never slept because I
would
go to work at six in the morning I would
work until six to eight pm I would go
home I would put the kids in bed because
my husband did dinner and dishes and
laundry
and I would be on my computer doing
everything else administratively until
two o'clock the next morning I would
sleep for two to four hours and do it
all again
well and you did that for how many years
eight years
yeah exactly that face right there it
was awful I don't think I worked that
much I work a lot it was awful it was I
do not recommend 0 out of five stars I
mean poor reviews and you didn't get
paid you weren't paying yourself at some
point
um
knowing what you know now do you think
you could go back and do it differently
or would it end result be the same
I think that there are a lot of things I
could change to make my lifestyle better
and my work life balance better
however
um
being constrained by the insurance
companies their restrictions and their
limited pay scale yeah
um I still think that the man hours and
the time would still be
huge comparatively and again I still
wouldn't have been able to give the
clients the care I think they needed
right because I did I had um three ptas
that I supervised constantly I mean
those rotated and I had a couple other
pts but I had at least three which was
the state Max at the time under me so I
had four or five people on my schedule
they had four or five people on their
schedule at the same time and I was keep
trying my best to be a good clinician
and a responsible PT and so I tried to
touch them all to speak to them all to
have my hands on them all
10 people an hour you're trying to
manage
or something
yeah plus phone calls Plus getting
interrupted by staff plus email you know
all the things so okay so
what um what's different now
that's so much Aaron it's so wonderful
um so now we treat clients one-on-one we
schedule 45 minute slots they're
typically here about an hour or so when
I tell the client that I'm going to
specifically focus on you and
individualize your care I can say it and
I can mean it and it's the truth right
um so add that plus I don't have to have
the headache of filing the insurance
doing appeals explaining benefits to the
clients
um it was a huge issue and I actually
got a phone call
yesterday from a client who's been
seeing an insurance-based practice
um
you know we would take their co-pay and
then we would submit insurance and
insurance would accept or deny or
approve or whatever and then we would
Bill the remainder and the next thing
that came through for the insurance we
would have to build the remainder of
that and so number one our accounts
receivable was Sky High and the income
was low
um and number two the client kept
getting bills and they didn't understand
why
so with the cash based system you know
we we do have packages that we sell so
when someone asked me how much is it per
visit I said I don't know until I put my
hands on you and I see you and I don't
but they know when they walk out the
door exactly how much it's going to cost
exactly how long I think it's going to
take to get them better and if it's more
than what a package we offer I'll tell
them that on the front end you know I
don't want them to be surprised I can be
a hundred percent transparent and open
with them about all of the financial
things
um which makes me sleep better at the
end of the day keeps them from getting
frustrated later
so you add all of that together and
for the first time in 12 years I'm
picking my kids up from school and going
to their sporting events and being the
mom that I wanted to be that was driving
me crazy when I wasn't yeah yeah and
even my 13 year old's actually in a room
back here but
um you know he even told me the other
day he was like Mom promise me you'll
never go back to that other way it's
like I miss the people that were there
and I love it but he said you we're
having you home is worth so much more
than anything you did there yeah that's
amazing so how many kids
to two boys and then we're working on an
adoption yeah awesome so yeah that's
great and how old are they and that's
the other thing
the other thing so Daniel is 13 and
Ethan is nine but the other thing I was
going to say too is um I've always had a
heart for adoption but I never had time
and I didn't have the money right and
nobody actually really has the money for
kids but um we're much better suited to
do it now and I have the time to be able
to devote to my kids now and it hasn't
been possible before so that's what um
is different now what did you do to make
this change besides like quitting and
starting a business like what were the
three big things that you've changed in
the way that you run the business or
your marketing or whatever else it is
that's made like the biggest difference
for you
okay good question so
um for us I would think um
primarily remembering why we're doing
what we're doing and not getting dragged
into the old routine of things
um
so being really focused on the reason
that we chose to do a cash PT practice
as opposed to going the insurance route
and working to death and all of the
things so mindset and perspective has
had a massive massive impact of what
we're doing
so that's I mean honestly that's that's
the thing I would say would be first um
so we also feel like this is like our
mission field and so we can serve God by
serving the people that come to us
um
and keeping focused on that helps but
with that
um joining Dr Aaron labauer's Platinum
Mastermind I'll do a Shameless plug for
that
um but that has helped me you're welcome
um but honestly though the shift and
what we've been able to accomplish
before that versus now has been huge so
number one
um we do not undervalue our services
and I actually had a client that was in
here today
who was on our very old rates which was
like 75 a visit
and it came in for me to look at his
shoulder today and so we went through
the whole total body Diagnostic and I
told him what was going on and we went
through everything
and so of course he was surprised
because the packages are much more
significant now so they're 225 the first
single visit now
and so his thing and he's he's a lawyer
he still dealt with medical things for a
long time he said how are you going to
get people in this area to do that
and I said well I said honestly it's
about priorities and it's about us being
able to get them to their end result and
not just selling the physical therapy
visit
so that was a perspective shift for me
too and I think that you're some of your
teaching helped with that a lot because
there are four other Physical Therapy
practices in this teeny little bitty
town but I get the people that they
can't get better because at the end of
the day I'm seeing their big picture I'm
seeing their end result and so I tell
them like if you want physical therapy
and that's all you want you can go down
the street I'll give you their names
their numbers their Google reviews but
if you want to get to your end result
this is where you need to be
and so that has changed a lot go ahead
yeah I was going to ask and then what
happened with this patient did he say
yes did you see like oh yeah he bought a
package yeah we're good I love it um but
he also has been through the mill he was
injured by another PT in town
um and honestly I mean it was it was
just because I think they weren't paying
attention yeah you know but with 55
million patients in front of you it's
hard
um the other thing that we have really
done differently
is um again
through some of your training and
teaching we began to read more of the
business minded books like Rocket Fuel
um by Gina Wickman and mark C Winters
um
so with that it has helped Dr Voss
Caitlyn and myself to
delineate out our tasks and get an
organizational structure that helps us
both focus on what we're best at and
what our skill set is and then the tasks
that don't fall into those what you call
zones of Genius
um
we have actually started delineating out
and delegating and not taking them back
for once in my life I'll tell you that
right yeah but it's been fantastic
that's awesome um but that yeah it is
and that allows us to focus on what
we're best at which is growing the
business
and evaluating the clients and you know
I guess being passionate and selling
what we're selling here which again is
is not just PT it's a lifestyle change
It's The End Result yeah yeah I remember
that first call we had and I recommended
that book um yeah it was fantastic and
and it's because people come to me and
they're like Aaron
um I've got a business partner or should
I get a business partner should I bring
my family member into the business and
I'm like
whoa take a minute you know because I've
I've done both of these things and and
I've seen people fail with it it's
really important to have
um two people that aren't doing the same
thing but they're complimenting each
other
right so can you talk a little bit more
about the difference between your role
and Caitlyn's role and how you guys have
split that up and what you're good at
and what she's good at
absolutely so um
with that book basically what it breaks
it down is to a Visionary and an
integrator you already know this but
just explaining it to the to the people
out there
um so they have a list of visionary
traits and they have a list of
integrator traits and in in the book in
the process you take the quiz all the
things but I didn't have to do that
because we already know who was who
after reading the first page
so and
um what's funny is anybody who's known
me for more than about six months will
tell you the same thing yeah um
so I am the Visionary I am typically
more of like the outspoken face of the
company I talk in front of people
Caitlyn hates to talk in front of people
she'll do it and she's wonderful at it
but it's not where she's comfortable
very passionate I
I always accomplished
with no resources and you know all the
things
um but I'm convinced that we can take
over the world right okay that's like
there's no question in my mind we can do
it
um and I have what they call Visionary
Whiplash which looking back for my old
business I see so much of that and I
wish I had known about that then but
it's like oh here's something shiny
that's a great idea and it is and then
we're halfway through that I didn't like
oh there's another idea let's chase that
one oh wait here's another idea let's
chase that one and at the time I didn't
like I had somebody that was kind of set
up as like a second in command but I did
not allow them to have that role very
well
um part of that was was me I mean a lot
of that was me
um because I would give a task and I
would take it back oh that's not the way
I want it it has to be perfect you know
I mean you always say 80 is good enough
and that's going to shift for us
um
but
so I have all of these huge ideas
and they're not all fantastic and that's
okay but you know I can go a million
different directions with them so my
weaknesses are staying focused
staying consistent communicating
um
I don't hold people accountable very
well because I forget I mean I'm going
to be honest with you I bounce from this
thing to this thing and I'm focused on
this thing and I don't even remember
what happened three weeks ago over here
so they're not just described me you
just described my life
that's why I told you to do it
um no yeah well
we started going through some of the
stuff I actually looked at my husband
and I said do you think I have ADHD and
he said do you think you don't I was
like
that's fair so
so yeah it's funny um but yeah but you
know back to the Visionary integrator
thing um let's Circle back around to
that let's Loop that right right sorry
well you know that's the tangent we can
go on and my next thought was like you
know well we just got schools in our
neighborhood too you know you know they
didn't know what to do with me on with
the Blackboard so you know
no and I'll tell you like yeah I get it
I get it it's funny yeah um so back to
back on track so yeah that's the
Visionary like right let's talk about
what's this so what's the integrator and
what does Caitlyn do for you guys in
your business right so Caitlyn is a very
cool calm presence of consistency for us
so I am up and down you can tell when
I'm talk I'm animated
um all over the place
um Caitlyn stays here
all the time you know she gets excited
she's passionate too but it's a
different kind of passionate
um so integrator strengths are leading
other people as far as
um giving tasks holding them accountable
she remembers everything or writes it
down I have no good organizational
system that's just not how my brain
works um if I don't write it down it's
gone I'll be honest with you but she is
really really good at organizing
everything
um she is incredible incredible
incredible communicating between like
the people that we have hired keeping us
on task for that
um she'll say oh yeah did you remember
two weeks ago we wanted to discuss and
I'm like
that's what I have you for I know I need
someone
hey she's incredible right now
you can yeah depends on how much you're
going to pay her and how much that's
going to come back to the business
no but um the other thing that's really
really good about her is um she's really
really good at sifting through all of my
big ideas and picking out the better
ones or the best ones right and keeping
me focused on that one goal so I'll be
like okay I think we need to try to do
this and she's like okay and then like
two weeks later I'm like hey why don't
we get shoes like Megan
now we talked about this let's finish
this first I'm like okay fine
and so it's like it's unfortunately I
love her to this she's like my mom here
um right but it's funny because we
actually say that I'm like the female
version of her husband and she's a
female version of my husband so it works
out really funny but it works well
um the other thing is the difference
between
the Visionary and the integrator is the
Visionary kind of sees more of where the
company is going to go
but the integrator is able to see how it
can get there so they're more
detail-oriented they see things in step
processes I just see look there's a big
huge thing that nobody says we can
attain let's go there
and she's like okay well instead of
trying to walk through the lava how
about we map it out so it's more
efficient and we actually get there
okay that sounds great
so yeah but it's it's been beautiful
yeah and I'm really lucky
oh I know I'm I'm not lucky honey I'm
blessed and she you know she feels the
same way she never wanted to own a
business that was not where she was
um so this is outside of her comfort
zone but I've seen her Bloom and Blossom
and mature so beautifully in this like
it's incredible just to watch our
mindset shift too
um but one of the other things that that
I always say and this is for my poor
husband too because he has to deal with
me
um but she is the perfect like woe to my
go
and I'm the go to her woe so if it were
up to me we would be going full steam
all the time but it doesn't necessarily
mean we would meet our goals right
um so just because you're doing a lot
doesn't mean you're getting a lot done
have you ever heard that quote so that's
kind of my brain
um but if it were up to her sometimes we
would sit and Ponder something for a
very long time and never implement or
take action
right and so it's just a beautiful like
balance of the two personalities that
makes it work yeah that's awesome yeah
that's where I was like before the
podcast it took me a while because I was
in integrator mode because I got to be
my own integrator sometimes and I was
trying to get through all the things
rather than just talking on podcasts and
recording videos and coming up with fun
ideas yeah
um you know and I think the the point is
is like you know I don't have like that
perfect match but I remember reading the
book it was like there's a small segment
of the population of their Visionaries
an even smaller segment that are like
the integrators to match you and um
exactly it's really lucky you found her
it is it's amazing you're blessed
lucky it's all of it yeah
um but again that's what makes us know
that again this is like our mission
field too because God put us together
perfectly but I actually hired her back
in 2016 in my old practice so we've been
together working since 2016 and what was
interesting is looking back on that time
now like she would come to me as my
employee and say Megan why don't you go
into this room and breathe a minute
and let's talk about it and I'm like
okay you know so it was funny because it
worked then and my husband told me for
years if you and Caitlyn open to
practice together you'd be amazing it
would be awesome
um and that's not to say that she
doesn't have Visionary characteristics
too because she does some of them were
kind of deep down in there
um and I have integrative
characteristics because I had to because
I did everything before
um but those aren't where our
personalities or characteristics really
Thrive and and work well so yeah it's
been amazing that's really awesome I'll
pray for you that you can find that
person thank you yeah part of it's like
finding it waiting going okay do I need
to you know where do I focus my time and
it is it's like it's someone I've been
looking for for a few years and I found
pieces in different places sure but it's
not like that that was it I can't
remember who who was that would Ray Kroc
uh had because you don't ever know the
guy's name or Lee iaco you don't ever
know the person's name you know because
they're not yes you know well and that's
the other thing too that with the
Visionary and integrator so the
integrator has so many beautiful traits
and strengths and all of the things but
they're typically like the unsung heroes
of the practice or of the company so you
got Walt and Roy Disney right it's the
same thing who's Roy dizzy well that was
Walt's brother that was his integrator
right yeah exactly but nobody knows that
name um but yeah so and it's amazing
because we didn't even know what this
relationship was until we read that book
and
um it's been really neat because we were
both still trying to kind of do
everything but together and being
respectful of each other's space and
decisions and time and all the things
um but once we read this book we were
able to actually break it down and
change it so that it works to our
advantage instead of trying to kind of
not necessarily step on each other's
toes but kind of run into circles and
behind her in front of each other that's
awesome yeah so I got a I got a someone
of a let's say a complex question but
maybe it's two parts uh-oh okay I'm
gonna try to make it easy I try to only
speak in fifth grade words
um but like the concept but here's the
concept is that I think there's a couple
things that you've said and shared
um that I haven't really uh had someone
on to talk about all both these things
it's one you've got a a vision and
Mission that you're doing God's work
through your practice
two you're charging 225 dollars and I've
had people come to me and say basically
God wouldn't want me to cheat people out
of their own money you know for physical
therapy and it's it's not I don't think
that thought is about God or about money
it's this combination of value right but
sure absolutely for one I want to know a
little bit more about what you guys said
how you're how you're working you're
like what what your mission is
um what you're doing and I know that's
um there's a lot of things you're doing
that we haven't even discussed and then
how do you balance that with charging
high prices you know to people
um and and feeling totally fine about it
like I would love you to share something
about that
yeah thank you for asking that question
um so that is honestly a big mindset
shift for us too
um I gave away a lot of free care when I
had my other practice
um what I've realized over time is the
problem with that is when you give a lot
of free care away and you don't have any
recompense in return
um
you can't continue
so in order for us to be able to provide
for our clients
provide for our families
have the time that allows us to continue
to grow and maintain what we're doing
there has to be a value associated with
that that makes it doable so let's say I
don't charge much per visit
and I have to see more patients that way
so then we start getting back into the
model that we were in before
where I'm divided too much my clients
don't get good care I have to sell
Physical Therapy instead of their actual
end result
I don't take help of pain don't take
home a paycheck for two years that is
not a sustainable practice model
and if I don't sustain this practice and
I don't sustain my family we have to
close and our clients don't get that
care right and they're left with the way
the insurance-based practices work again
which again is why we did this too
because I didn't want to leave that is
the only option and people to think
that's all Physical Therapy was
so the other thing and you talk about
this a little bit in the ethical
influence training
but
as a
physical therapist as medical
professional
but more importantly for me with my
faith-based if I know I have an answer
that can help someone's problem
it is not okay for me to keep that to
myself it's my ethical obligation to
offer them a service
that helps them get better
and if I don't charge a particular rate
I won't be able to continue to do that
now some things we do offer because we
don't refund on our packages but let's
say I have somebody who is a little more
financially able okay we'll say that
than some others and they buy a 10 or 12
visit 15 visit package and let's say
hallelujah amen were even more effective
than we thought they're better in six
visits okay
so we offer to allow them number one
they can keep those visits forever they
never expire
or
they can give it to a friend or family
member
um or three they can put it into what we
call a pool of visits
and there are some clients that again we
don't accept everybody who comes in the
door because we want them to really want
to be here we want to know that they're
going to work for it but we actually
have a pool of visits that we can pull
from other people who have donated a
visit to some of those other clients
yeah awesome so it allows us to be able
to give to give that the other thing um
that you've talked about a lot too
is you know the more money you have the
more money the more your money can
matter
um so make more money so your money can
matter more
and so we are very very deep rooted in
this community so we have
um really four or five
faith-based Community organizations that
we give back to
and that's either by you know giving a
visit or it's by giving donations when
they need it it's by
um you know advertising for them on our
social media page attending events
getting other people to attend events
but when we Network we don't just
Network for ourselves we're networking
for everybody in our family we call it a
family because it's what we are
um and then we have a couple of overseas
missions that we work with we have a
Ministry called blessed by address where
we bring prom dresses or whatever in and
they go right back out and so if we were
not able to sustain this business
monetarily financially sound all of that
would go away too
yeah so our reach our reach and for
Missions and for God would be much less
if we devalued our services to the point
of making us close or not able to
continue
that's awesome thank you that's
important absolutely you know and I've
had people I don't know maybe if you
guys have do you guys do a
percentage of what you earned that you
give away do you know do you have it
like or maybe Caitlyn has that and
you're just like I have it in my head
somewhere it's like you know things it's
like you know things
um yes is that like built in like do you
have like a percentage of what we earn
is built in to give away and donate
correct yes
um and then the other thing we do um is
we also again we're very vocal about the
fact that we're Mission based and we're
Ministry based and so if a client comes
in with a need
um and let's say it's not a need that
necessarily financially they can supply
they can they can afford to come here
for care because they're looking for
their why and their result but let's say
they need something that they just can't
get or they can't find we have such a
beautiful incredible Network in our
community that usually we can help with
that so we got a queen size bed for a
young girl who just moved in with her
grandparents um the dresses you know
things like that we get food for people
we're involved with a lot of the
different groups in the community so um
you know that that's that's a beautiful
thing too but we do it based off of a
percentage yes of what we bring in per
month
um and yes Caitlyn has that I don't
um like I said it's like you know things
um people are like what is you know what
does this look like I'm like I looked at
it three minutes ago
between I know it was good or I know it
wasn't so good we need to work on it
um but um but yeah so we have it kind of
built in we both picked organizations
that either we both felt drawn to or
there were a few that were specific for
me or specific for her or specific to
the community
um and so we do our best to make sure we
disperse the funds the way that we feel
like we're led to do yeah that's really
awesome that's really great um if you
had uh one piece of advice to people who
are wanting to grow or scale their
business or you know start over when
they started you know in you know
Insurance what what would it be what's
the one lesson you've learned that you
want to pass on to someone else
so the biggest lesson is um
when it gets hard don't just give up
um there were so many times where we
discussed taking Insurance again
or we discussed doing it a different way
but every time that we thought about
turning that doorknob
we reminded ourselves as of why we were
doing it this way
um so I guess that would be I guess it's
a two-part thing number one is when it
gets hard don't give up but number two
you need to make sure you have a solid
why you're doing what you're doing
um and I talked about this at our
Mastermind retreat but if you don't have
the real deep reason for why you're
doing what you're doing you're not going
to continue when it gets hard
you're just going to say oh well it's
not that important let's just give up
so I totally agree with that that would
be
yeah I see that all the time it's one of
the first questions on our applications
of like why is this important to you
they say no exactly even with the paid
with the patients or coaching clients
it's like if you don't know why you're
not going to get up at 5am to do the
work that's necessary
and that's exactly right and that's you
know we we use a lot of that with our
clients and we sell packages and things
like that that's another way that people
decide to come here is because we try
really hard before we ever make a pitch
for the sale or for the the package
number one it shows that we really care
and that's another quote I love people
don't care how much you know until they
know how much you care
um
but we want to know why is this
important to you why do you want to get
better
um and if we can find that our clients
are much more likely to be invested and
to see the value monetarily but more
than that for us they're more likely to
actually make the lifestyle change to
make that goal a reality too yeah yeah
that's so awesome very cool
um Megan I could like ask you 20 more
questions but I know you and I both have
other things on our plate for the day we
do
um
let's see if if someone wants to reach
out and uh touch base with you connect
with you what's the best place for them
to find you
very much honestly
um but we could either do Facebook which
is Stinson and false
um Physical Therapy we have a website
www.stensonenvosspt.com it's a mouthful
but it was available whenever we started
um and then we of course we have email
addresses which you can find on our
website and then our phone number
423-225-2554 okay you sure you want
people to blow up your phone right
I don't mind hey I'm I'm all about
helping others and teaching people and
there's a great thing with Google Voice
you can actually turn it off and it goes
to voicemail perfect
perfect okay yeah we'll have all the all
those details in the in the show notes
or you can press the back button for 10
seconds three times to get on the
um on the on iTunes
um this is really great and you're
speaking of pdbizcon coming up in a few
weeks so
um do you excited yeah do you have a a
couple teasers about what you're gonna
talk about
well you heard some of it here
um one of the things that you and I had
discussed was talking about saying in
your zone of genius and
um we're going to talk about where we've
been so that's Insurance based first
where we were
um when we started the cash practice
which was not doing great to be honest
with you
um it's a big learning curve for us but
the community as well
um and then where we are now after the
Platinum Mastermind and really really
focusing and keying in on working where
we work best yeah that's awesome and you
had to run in with the mayor of your
town in Newport yes
yeah we had a city county event today so
I got to sit next to the mayor I felt
really special for a minute that's
awesome and how many people I was gonna
ask this for how many people live in
Newport
I do not ask Caitlyn okay it's not very
big
it's not it's not very big and honestly
the socioeconomic status here is not
great either yeah um but again it all
comes down to people's priorities and
their why and if they really want to be
here they'll make it work yeah that's
awesome and if they don't want to make
it work they're not our client so a lot
of people see me oh my Town's too small
or people here aren't rich and wealthy
and I'm like it doesn't matter but they
don't believe me you know and I'm I mean
it's you know hopefully they hear enough
people like you doing it you know that
they're like oh I can do it in my town
because it is really a matter of
priorities wouldn't you agree
yeah oh absolutely I mean I had a lady
that came in after a total hip
replacement she'd been to several of the
places here in town that did the way
that we talked about
um and she and her husband had an old
car that had just been sitting there
they sold a car so she could get care
for her hip here instead of someplace
else
I mean I'm not recommending everybody go
sell your car to come see me you know
but
it comes down to what their priorities
are right right that's awesome dude

proud of you guys and um I'm super like
