if you're in a physician-owned practice
you ain't got to be good you just got to
be there just got to be at the end of
the conveyor belt and just sign your
name to a bunch of things and measure a
few things and cut off some theraband 35
years of that retire in Florida and
think you did something but all you help
people do is suffer comfortably
