i think when i downsized and i went to
part-time i started to realize that
what a boost i had to my energy level
my emotional intelligence i guess if you
will
that i just didn't want to go back there
you know i
have done seven or eight patients a day
but that's not a good number for me
i think because i do so many other
things outside of work that
i need that balance and for me that's
the balance i i know other people can do
more and that's fine
but for me four is a safe number and
it's a fair number
because after that it's just not really
fair to the people
what's up welcome back to the cash bt
lunch hour podcast uh this is your host
aaron levauer and today my special guest
is julie lee
julie is one of my platinum mastermind
members and the owner of
issaquah mfr in issaquah washington
which is right outside of seattle
and julie is um someone who have known
quite a while
and has moved her practice across
country and
in the last year she's totally crushing
it while being like a
part-time stay-at-home mom and so i
wanted to bring her on
uh the show because she's got a unique
story and um
inspiring uh things that she's gonna
share with you or hopefully we'll dig
out of her today so
julie thank you for uh being here today
i really appreciate it
thanks for having me i'm a full-time mom
you're a full-time mom oh yeah it
doesn't mean
let me go back and say you're a
part-time business owner full-time mom
or
well what is it because you you
basically have your your daughter at
home full-time and you're
running a part-time practice so tell me
like what do you call that and
how are you making it work because i
think that's the secret that we need to
get into today it's crazy
well she's not at home with me anymore
um she's home with me on monday because
i'm off on monday so i'm not really off
i'm not really ever off you know i
specify that i'm a full-time mom because
you're never off the clock
that's true which is fun but it's crazy
and we just roll with it like 20 20.
anyway
um she she has help for school tuesday
through friday yeah and
i help her on monday this summer it was
different wasn't it
well she was in camp okay and then there
are certain
breaks that they have where she's home
with me but initially she was gonna come
to me
come with me to the clinic for certain
days and then i just realized that's not
working because people were so
stressed out and they needed that safe
place it wasn't so much that she was
disrupting the treatment she's very
respectful
even being seven years old but people
need a place to cry
they need a place to screen they need a
place to cost they need a place to let
go
and i need to hold that space sacred for
them so um
i made sure that i could maintain those
boundaries and i just have to limit my
schedule so i work 9 30 to 3 30
and that's all i can do and i work
tuesday through saturday yeah that's
awesome so this summer and the reason i
wanted to bring that up because i get
a lot of people say aaron i can't
possibly get started because
i have baby on the way moms and dads you
know it's like well i can't because i
have i don't want to take time away from
my family
i because i have all these things but
this summer as
things change with covet i think a big
part of it was
your daughter was probably just staying
home with you and not going to camp or
doing a different
schedule and you're like aaron how do i
make this work because i have a limited
amount of time
right well yeah in the beginning when
covet first hit and they were navigating
that school was closed and she was
online
so she was helped with me um in march
and april
and how did you make it work you know
my husband took some time off and i i
took that time to set some systems in
place that i
didn't set up before just because i got
busy and then it's hard to do it all
when you're parenting and i get that
but you just have to make time for it
you know like talk about time blocking
and i would set so many hours um
allowing me to work on my systems and so
many hours
to give my husband respite and so many
hours to play with her to go outside
because we make that a priority
to get outside no matter what so um
everything has to have a limit you know
right right and that's awesome and i
think
um i think a lot of people talking about
that a lot of people have time
have difficult time prioritizing right
practicing family or work
um you know how do you how do you choose
and
how do you make sure that you're able to
do you know
both of them like you know family stuff
get you know getting your business
uh you know up to the level of success
that you've had this year
it's hard you know um but i'm definitely
committed to that because i went all
in and that was backed by my husband so
he
absolutely supported my decision and
he's carved out time in his schedule to
allow me to do the things that i need to
do
so it's it's definitely they're
trade-offs you know
what did have you guys um had to have
like tough conversations around business
or has he always
been supportive of you no he's always
been supportive
yeah why you know well i think
let me back up yeah in 2014 i want to
say it was a slow start to the year
and he asked me one day do you ever just
think about
getting a regular ot job again and i
said no
i said i would sell my body before i
bill insurance again and
and um or go back to work as an employee
and he never asked me again yeah yeah
so let's go back you had a you had a
practice initially in memphis
um when did you start that and you know
can you tell us a little bit about um
what you had set up and i think it was
you said uh insurance and cash or were
you
like did you start one way and do the
other thing
yeah so when in my memphis practice
i went all in in my mind at the time in
2011 we found a foreclosed property
in the heart of downtown the heart of
the business district
and it was right where i wanted to be so
we
built it out that took three months and
i opened doors and i did a mix of
insurance and
and cash paid then over time i started
getting frustrated with reimbursement
rates they were so extremely low
i started phasing out of insurance and
then about seven and a half years into
the
practice we were both kind of working
two jobs in the sense that my husband's
always worked odd hours and he would
um help me in the morning and then he
would go to work or if he worked nights
sometimes
his schedule changed but in the
beginning he was working a midnight
shift so he would help me a little bit
in the morning
and sleep and go to work or you know mix
it up like that and then after having my
daughter
i was managing the practice and i was
busy with patients all day and then i
would go home and parent
and we were both kind of tired with that
um and we decided to downsize and so we
sold my office space
and i switched to part time and
um my hours became like 7 30 to 3 30.
so anyway i moved into a professional
ballet studio ballet memphis and i saw
patients
there and it worked out great i really
loved the slower pace of things and
having more time
to do some things that i wanted to do
and have more time to be ready
to parent full-on in the evening so
knowing how well that worked for me
that's what i wanted to continue
you know it's really it is hard to do
both but
i think it's doable so anyway yeah you
were you
said something like so we first started
recording it and the technology didn't
work and you said something
really awesome you said my husband asked
you said your husband asked you a
question when you got started well can
you
right so we get in 2011
and that's when we came up on this
property and so we had this idea because
i've always wanted to have
my own practice and it ended up
happening sooner than later but he asked
me do you want to have a business or do
you want to have a baby
and i said well both and he said well
which first and i said well the business
that what it won't work the other way
around so
um yeah we got started yeah that's
awesome
uh what do you think has been the thing
that's allowed you
um you know even even before you moved
to
you know seattle like in memphis like
what allowed you to be successful what
were the
things that you were doing um then uh
that were working well and whether it
was in business marketing or
you know uh with your schedule and
relationship with your husband and
family stuff
mm-hmm yeah in memphis it was different
you know i
had lived there for a long time so
people knew me in the community
i had a lot more of a network built in i
never really marketed to be
honest with you it kind of just grew
word of mouth like when i first started
practicing a myofascial release i was
practicing all my triathlon teammates
and many of them came to my house for me
to you know increase my confidence with
my skills
and then they just started paying me and
so it became
this side business you know and then i
went to work for
susan jenkins who had a practice in all
branch mississippi and i worked for her
for four years
before i met my husband and went out on
my own um
and during that time i was seeing a lot
of people on the side it just got to be
too much and i was like
oh look you guys have to come to the
clinic i can't keep doing this
and so you know they followed me to
mississippi and then when i started my
practice they followed me back
to memphis and um it really just grew
word of mouth with
you know the running community the
cycling community
the triathletes i saw athletes of all
types
gymnasts tennis players hockey players
a professional baseball player one time
who was just in town to scout
for the red birds which was pretty cool
um
so i worked a lot with recreational
athletes um
and it really was 80 word of mouth i had
some google ads but to be honest
i never really tweaked them they just
kind of would run in the background
and um would pay for themselves right on
and then
um you guys moved uh out to seattle to
issaquah
like when when did you guys move in uh
what prompted the move
you know just a life change i always
thought that the wind would blow us west
and my cousin got married here
last well actually two august ago and
i just thought it was absolutely amazing
it was really more of a calling before
it was a conscious choice almost in the
same
sense that happened to me in memphis
because i was prepared to go anywhere
graduating from college
but i just felt like it was time for a
change
and instead of waiting until my daughter
graduated from high school
we thought we could be enjoying this now
so we're gonna take this risk let's do
it now and if it doesn't work we could
still recover financially or whatever
but
it was just one thing that i felt i
would regret if i didn't try
in my lifetime and so i wanted to take
that risk and do it now
that's awesome what so what's what do
you like so great about like seattle
like i mean i've been there at school
there's a big needle and they throw fish
at the
supermarket but it's cold and rainy
right
it is but i think it's amazing i think
even the mist
in the morning it's just i see the mist
over the mountains and i think it's
beautiful and inspiring and there's so
much nature to enjoy here i love
trail running and hiking and um getting
on the water
paddling and things like that there's
just so much to do and so much to
explore
even my patients say you won't even get
through it all in your lifetime there's
so much to do here and i love that i
love that my daughter's gonna grow up
with the natural resources here
there's just so much to see you know
we've made an effort to make concentric
circles and exploring around seattle
and still like it just you know kind of
wet your appetite for more
so i feel like i kind of have adhd for
everything you can do outside
and i have a long to do list but i'm i'm
just kind of you know
checking things off that bucket list
right right what's the oh my gosh
uh what's the big mountain out there
it's called uh
veneer yeah mount rainier that's it get
all my big mountains uh mixed up but i
know i can see it
clearly because uh the pictures it's
almost always snow-capped
yeah you also climb that this summer
right
that's like that's not an easy thing to
do
no it you have to be prepared yeah i
mean you had to train
so this summer you were training to
climb mount rainier
you're working on growing your business
being a full-time mom
like where'd you like how did you feel
like you you you didn't just like
you know take a vacation and start a
business you like
work for like a couple different goals
can you tell us about like how did you
like how much time did that take and how
did you fit that in to your schedule
i carve time out on my schedule so
um basically it's a four-month training
program that i followed
and knowing how much time it was going
to take me each day
and each week i would block that off my
schedule so that i wasn't overbooked
because i have a tendency to take my
time away from myself
when someone else calls me in a crisis
and it was just an absolute boundary
that i couldn't give up
so um i would see you know a couple
people
and go work out and then if i had time
to see someone else maybe i would but it
would just depend so
i would have to fit it in with my
daughter's camp schedule right right on
that's that's cool and not everyone
makes it to the top like a lot of times
people
get to halfway up and the weather is bad
or
right yeah it has a 50 success rate and
you know it's a very aggressive
elevation gain most people don't really
realize that rainier is like a
freestanding mountain next to an ocean
where
you know you're at sea level and then
you're climbing to 14 000
so it's not that tall but when you you
know when you get in the parking lot
you're at 1500 whereas if you go to
colorado and you
go hike you're already at 6 000 so it's
not much of a game
yeah it's pretty good it's an aggressive
game for this human climb
and a lot of people get sick so that's
one thing that happens or they're not as
prepared as they think
and you know you have to be um
able to go hard for nine to 12 hours and
you're roped to your partners and so
you're responsible for their safety and
they're responsible for yours so you
want to make sure that you're ready to
do this mentally and physically
yeah wow that's awesome that's so cool i
got shivers just thinking about that
that's really awesome and
but it's one of those things where
that's a lot like business wouldn't you
agree
right you gotta sometimes you just gotta
go hard there's a big elevation gain
you don't always get to the top by
yourself especially by yourself
right um you need a good team yeah
you do you need a good team and people
around you so what
uh so you moved out to seattle and by
the time
this spring rolled around um when we
first started talking again
um things had changed were different
like what was different about
restarting your business there like what
like what worked well what didn't
like you know and what was happening
um here i found that people weren't as
friendly
they weren't as receptive to networking
with me you know i really had to get out
of my comfort zone and knock on doors
and introduce myself and i didn't get a
lot
i didn't get a warm welcome i didn't get
reception there yeah so
i kind of stopped that and i just
realized i have to do what i
can do i have to focus on what i can
control which is me
so i started working on the thing that
were in your um cash bt blueprint
and the um
the blog post that you put out about
improving your organic google rankings
yeah i did everything you said and that
made a huge difference
within three months that's awesome
that's awesome what like was there
anything specific that you
like that you're like that you did that
you
saw work or you know was it a uh
you know was it was there something like
specific that you did that you can share
or
you remember or was it just like a kind
of a um
combination of things you know raising
my rates
yeah offering prepaid plan of care
packages
tweaking my website to include the
application
does that help sweet out your serious
potential patients your prospective
patients um
getting the google reviews
the um videos
and listing the website on the very
first line
and just slowly building that library on
my website
that got positive feedback the patients
really loved it especially during covid
when
we took a break from meeting in person
and that was one reason why i started it
to keep them accountable for the
exercises that i wanted them to do
that no matter how many times in person
we'd go over it they'd still come back
with questions and
you know and wanted clarification where
to put the ball where to put the foam
roll
you know how long do i hold this and
what am i doing here and that sort of
thing like their proprioceptive
awareness just really wasn't there like
they thought even for some of my really
athletic and stronger clients
and so that was really helpful they
really liked that and so i just been
building that
yeah that's awesome that's awesome what
um
because it like you didn't have to do
that before because would you had
more time in memphis or just you know
was there something where people
just more was it that they were more
receptive to networking
or i think it's just because they knew
me
you know personally and they knew me you
know in the sport
and so they trusted me but um yeah so
that word of mouth was
was more organic um girls were organic i
didn't really have to work for them
there was a running store that i was
shopping at for 18 years and i knew the
staff i treated most every all the staff
and they sent referrals my way
especially when they weren't responding
to traditional modalities which was
super helpful and appreciated
and so we kind of had that um
relationship also my team you know i've
received a lot of referrals from my
teammates and from
friends and family members and then it
also would spread from there so it
wouldn't be uncommon for me to see the
whole family you know i'd see one spouse
and i'd see the other spouse and i've
seen the children i am seeing
grandparents and
that started happening here too yeah
yeah and i mean is that
only happening more recently now or is
you know was it no
from the beginning but um
i definitely have people that i feel
like here in seattle they're so much
more focused on their health and
wellness
and they have no problem paying for it
you know they'll put money down
as long as they're getting the results
and so i have patients that are anxious
that
you know i'm almost going to have to
push them out of the mess they want to
stay on
and it's like i can't retain everybody
because then i can't see new people
so i'm kind of having that problem with
the overflow which is a great problem to
have
but you know you want them to have some
confidence in what they're doing and
they have to test the water too and get
back out there because i can't treat
them forever
right right but and that's a good
problem
right it's like what do i do i've got
people i've got i don't have enough room
for
new patients um but you're not seeing
but like like we said before you're not
seeing i mean you're not seeing 40 30
people a week you're
how many people a week are you treating
right now no i i can only see four
people
a day because that's the amount of time
that i have while my daughter's in
school
so i see a maximum of 16 a week that's
awesome
that's awesome and um 18 but that's not
fun
i mean i like i got to the point where
if i saw 26 people a week i was
exhausted and just like
you know like 18 20 i was like i could
do this all the time
you know it's like it was a great number
yeah it's a great balance for me
and it's not so much the physical work
it's it's the
emotional you know i can listen with my
full body for about four hours
yeah you know i'm glad you bring that up
because i know a lot of
uh young therapists um even uh
kaitlyn who you know works for me you
know they don't really learn how
to um balance or handle
like the emotions from other people like
they're not really taught that in
pt school like i was taught that in my
massage therapy training
and i took it for granted and i was like
you didn't talk about this and pt like
we're seeing more people
did you know how did you learn about
that or figure that out
you know i think when i downsized and i
went to part time
i started to realize that what a
boost i had to my energy level um
and emotion um my emotional intelligence
i guess if you will
that i just didn't want to go back there
you know i i
have done seven or eight patients a day
but that's not a good number for me
so i think because i do so many other
things outside of work that
i need that balance and for me that's
the balance i i know other people can do
more and that's fine
but for me four is a safe number and
it's a fair number
because after that it's just not really
fair to the people
how do you make sure like do you have a
way that you make sure that you're
not taking home other people's like
baggage negative emotions
you know like letting that affect you
i think exercise helps you know um
but i do practice grounding and
centering
and before and after clients there are
things that i would do to make sure that
i'm kind of shifting that off of me just
in case
yeah right on i don't feel like it's too
much of a problem
yeah cool cool yeah i mean sometimes
like you know
um if i see too many people or you know
have people that have a lot of uh
negative energy like i feel at the end
of the day or if i'm not centered i'll
feel it
more you know but if i i got to a point
where
it didn't take me very long to feel uh
centered and ready for patients
uh but if i wasn't paying attention
someone would take me off
off balance and like it would affect me
um
so uh you know but i know that like
it's hard to explain how to do that it's
hard to explain
but a lot of people probably recognize
what that feels like you know
you know have you ever worked for that
like with if i feel like i can't do it
on my own and i need some energy to help
dissipate it then i'll use
it works on myself oh that's awesome
that's cool
um have you ever like had the experience
um
were you like right before you walked
into a treatment room or treatment with
a patient you like
felt something in your body and you're
like oh that's interesting and then
they're like hey this is exactly where
you're like wait a minute that's did
have you ever had that kind of
experience
with people you know what happens a lot
when i'm treating someone and i feel it
in my body and i think that's because
i'm such
a like intuitive and empathic person
yeah that that's happened so much over
the years like even
from the very beginning of taking
seminars that
i don't discount it you know yeah i'll
almost like feel it beforehand and i'm
like oh
this is what you know like the person
starts telling me where they're hurting
like oh i've been feeling that you know
it's weird you know um i'll often feel
the releases of my own body
yeah yeah that's really neat and so
you're an occupational therapist so
i want to ask like not many occupational
therapists go into
like private practice for themselves
doing mostly like manual therapy
mfr you know etc can you
how did you end up down this path
you know it's interesting in school i
had a really hard time with deciding
between physical therapy and
occupational therapy
and i took the prerequisites for both
and so
at the last second i kind of veered into
ot because i thought i'd have more room
for creative expression
in the field and i thought at the time i
was going to be a pediatric occupational
therapist
so that's what i did but i felt like
really hard
to let go of you know treating the whole
body and i was very fortunate that i've
always been cross-trained by pts and
i've always worked closely with pts and
they were never territorial with me
they were always you know sharing what
they learned and you know i felt like
it was a very um nurturing
relationship with the other pts that i
work with you know they let me work on
the lower body and they'd work on the
upper body and it wasn't like oh no stay
in your lane
upper upper body only and so a lot of
the patients that we'd co-treat
you know require two or three people on
them when i initially got into
myofascial release i was working with
severely compromised individuals that
were wheelchair-bound non-verbal
and had just a long list of diagnoses
and issues and they required
two or three people to transfer out of
their wheelchair onto the table
and so we always work with them as a
team
the speech therapist the physical
therapist and
and myself as the ot on the team and so
we got
great results doing that and i think you
know coming from that end of the bell
shaped curve and then like
starting to work on these athletes in my
home and then you know when i went
part-time into the ballet studio i saw
more like everyone else in the center so
i feel like i've seen all ends of the
spectrum and
everyone's responded beautifully to the
work
that's awesome you know it's one of
those things where i
forgot that you were an ot like you said
something this summer i was like oh yeah
just like a visual therapist it's like
you know i think
um which i think is great because i
think when we get to a place where
pts ots even chiropractors you know and
other professions like
where we feel like we there's no
distinction like i feel like that's
where we're doing some of our
our best work because it's patient
centered and in a way rather than
uh you know like body parts centered and
you know
problem centered right you put in the
person and the fabric and the context of
their life and their goals and i think
that's
essentially what an occupational
therapist does like we can justify
pretty much anything
but it just depends on what their issues
are you know right
absolutely so we um
so we met at uh malfoy release three
seminar was almost like five years ago
and oh it was longer than that is it
longer than that like eight months gosh
was it it was so it was but i've i've
known you before i don't know we had met
at a seminar before that or not i can't
remember but i we had been in contact
through email or through one of the
email listsers um i think i saw you at
it was either quantum leap oh yeah it
was
quantum leap and and delaware right yeah
yep and i think i was thinking about
transitioning
out of medicare and transitioning out of
insurance and i asked you some questions
oh well you mind if i ask you a couple
questions
and you said oh sure i love it
so anyway we talked about that and then
after that conversation i did hire an
attorney to help me navigate
opting out of medicare yeah i did and
successfully yeah that's awesome and
there's slightly different
rules like i know we don't have enough
time to go into that with uh
on the podcast but uh if you're
interested there's i've got a lot of
other episodes and blog posts just go
search
the blog and there's medicare stuff but
was there anything specific
with the attorney that you had to do or
um or change or make sure that it was
running the right way so that you could
see medicare patients doing
occupational therapy with them well
she's she um tweaked some of the
documents
but then i shortly after that i moved
yeah
it didn't apply but we know that that it
was effective because i received a
letter
a year later acknowledging that i was
opt out
okay so yeah and that's a big difference
like with pt's we can actually
opt out we have you know we have to have
like two other things in place but yeah
people say that but you know they have
an option on the website
and i called and the staff the rep
walked me through the process so it's
like if we can't opt out then why would
it be on the website and why would they
have the knowledge of being able to walk
me through the process right
yeah and i think that's the difference
because like ot is included in that but
not
pt i think it's one of those things so
depends on who you ask
right um what uh so julie um
you had said something to me also this
summer it was i was like this is awesome
and i was like
we need to talk about this more you said
uh you sent me a text message like
check out what you know how how my
business is doing
uh the other mfr therapists wouldn't
believe this like
you know can you you could just share a
little bit about
you know what is it that like where did
that come from like what is it that you
felt like
other people wouldn't believe that you
were able to do with your business or
with patients
i think well moving and having
like zero support system and network in
the community
and being able to build from nothing
literally
to um the caseload which for me i work
part-time
um four patients a day i think a lot of
people have this
mindset that you can't make a living
working part-time
or you can't make a living as a
myofascial release therapist only seeing
one patient a day and i i've known
therapists that i thought oh i could
work with this person when i was
thinking of con possibly built like
building and bringing other people on
um getting to know them through that
process and i realized okay we actually
can't work together or that's not gonna
work
you know for different reasons but a lot
of them have that mindset is that you
can't make
a living doing this and so they don't
even want to try they don't even want to
take the risk
and i know a lot of people don't want to
take the risk and i understand that and
i appreciate it but
i also know that i don't fit the mold
you know
i don't really like to be micromanaged
and
um it's just interesting that ended up
being this way
for me that i've kind of paid my own but
it the fact that it you know started
from nothing and then people
as soon as i opened people started
coming i had clients the first day i
opened
and it wasn't like people were banging
down my door but i had enough to pay my
bills
you know which was a promising sign and
then as i started making those changes
that you recommended
it started growing exponentially by
october
it exploded and so um it's been
my caseload's been full since like late
september early october
that's awesome and i you know just for i
want to share context with everyone out
there i mean you're making more per
month
um seeing people part-time than a lot of
people make doing full-time i mean
you're
what you've shared with me is well over
a six-figure month like figure
uh like months where you you're
generating your
you know whatever six figure years with
just the month so like i think
you've you've showed me that uh you're
on pace to you know crushing it with
what people are able to earn and what
people are able to do
and i think i think it's awesome um and
i'm
super stoked and proud of you to have uh
months where you're saying like hey i'm
seeing four people a day and making over
ten thousand dollars in a month
or more you know like i don't know your
books but i want to share people that
i think that it is because there's a
misconception that we can't
earn a lot of money and we shouldn't ask
for a lot of money for a healthcare
service
wouldn't you agree yeah definitely why
do you think people are afraid of
you know like how much they can earn or
how much they should ask for or
even that they can't make enough money
doing what we're doing
you know i don't know i think there's a
lot of deep-rooted emotional issues with
money and
mindset with money that people have from
long ago
and even i've had to work on that you
know but when i got here i realized in
order to make this work
i shouldn't be struggling you know if i
can only see four people a day
they have to pay right because i need to
make sure they're not going to waste my
time
that they need business and they're
going to be committed to the process
because otherwise i'm going to go run
trails right
run trails or hang out with your
daughter that's like right we'll do
something else
yeah yeah because what is that because
you've
uh got to the point where you realize
that your time is you've well you've
clearly realized your time is valuable
you know or you would be valuable and we
just won't ever get more time we can
always make more money but we will never
get more time
so i think that's why i shifted my focus
away towards like doing things on my
bucket list
even if it took longer for me to grow my
business and then i think detaching from
that outcome
um i don't know i just started
attracting people who were dead serious
about it and
um it's been great yeah that's awesome
it's
i mean it sounds like that's something
that even allowed you guys to move
across
uh across country and be like this is
our bucket list we may as well do it now
rather than later
i mean right you know it's not something
yeah it's not something you picked up in
the last year
do you know where like are there any
other experiences you've had that
have helped you be able to make those
decisions or take the risks and
i listen to my body and i just had to
trust my gut
you know um when i graduated from
college and i spent resumes all over the
us literally from california to you know
the coast
of north carolina and i went on a
handful of interviews but when i went to
memphis like i felt my solar plexus
open up and bottom out and that's always
a sign for me that it's the right thing
so when i was like memphis really but
yeah
tennessee became three-dimensional on
the map and that's where i was going to
land
and so anyway it kind of grew from there
but that
that similar thing happened when i
visited washington
i'd always wanted to come i had good
intentions it just didn't happen then
when my cousin got married
we made it a priority and when we came
out here my husband was nudging me he's
like look
look look look look at reneer and i was
like oh what oh my god and
just the energy i felt like my energetic
anchor
had already been uprooted like i said
before it became a conscious choice for
me to move i feel like the decision was
already made that i needed to be here
and it felt right so that's awesome
that's awesome not many people are able
to to do that i know i mean how many
people i talked to are able to say okay
i'm gonna
trust my instinct and you know go for it
because they've had a lot of um
times in the past where they've made
what they feel are bad decisions
you know you know i don't know that's
just really cool i mean is there
i mean are there times where you've made
decisions like that you're like oh this
wasn't the right one or is it
does that do those feel different when
you look back on them
um no i think that when we saw the place
that we purchased for my first clinic
you know that felt right my solar plexus
bottomed out and i knew that was the
right spot
so we did it and you know we sunk a lot
of money into that place
um it was amazing but
i don't regret it you know um if i still
lived in memphis we'd have that thing
paid off because
my husband really didn't pay me we put
all my money back into the clinic
to pay it down because that was the goal
thinking we were going to be there for
30 years
but um i'm glad we did it you know and
then we went in star contrast
to me being in this minimalistic space
here which has worked out beautifully
also and that wasn't my intention
my intention was to stay small because
it worked for me in the in the ballet
studio
but now it's growing organically and so
it's kind of funny
that's awesome yeah that's cool so what
julie what uh
what are your goals for next year and
even you know three to five years from
now
i probably need to hire some help so
that's on my list
um working on my technology skills so i
have some goals related to that
um i also have a climb scheduled in
europe
assuming that travel flows and you know
but i'm gonna train like it's happening
and we'll see what happens
um you know
i see the business growing i see it
expanding
i see another part-time or maybe
full-time therapist
and so we'll kind of have to see how
that how that goes but i would love to
have coverage
so that there's continuity of care for
my clients so i can do these climbs
without guilt
because they have a lot of anxiety when
i'm not working
right so how many climbs are there you
have like a is there a certain number
that you're
aiming for well there's three that are
on the bucket list
and then after that it'll be just for
fun so
what are the other climb says rainier
and what else um
vernier was one and then mount albress
and russia
is on the on the dock for this year
cool do you have like i mean anything
cool like uh
uh well kilimanjaro i don't know how
hard that one is but i know that's
pretty
impressive uh and then there's the movie
the old clint eastwood movie the iger
counter i think that was in switzerland
i can't remember
you know that one was cool i mean
because i saw that as a kid and as an
adult and i'm like
i want to climb up there that looks cool
do you have any of those swiss mountains
on your list well mom blanc's on there
um and that's also contingent on if we
can't do elbrus then mont blanc
is second place but um i want to do them
both at some point but i'm putting
priority on the 7-7 but
probably won't get in all seven seven so
anyway
russia and then um argentina
and then alaska so we'll see cool so
what does that mean seven
seven the seven peaks on the seven
summits of the seven continents
got it that's awesome it was probably
four yeah and then i'll be content yeah
that's cool that's really cool so um
looking back uh if you were talking to
someone else
we're going to recommend uh or give some
advice to someone else even like another
mfr therapist who we're connected uh
with who wants to
you know grow their business and uh you
know even do it without insurance like
what would
be your number one recommendation or or
any success tips that you have
so go for it yeah you trust your
instincts
and to take those risks that's awesome
yeah sometimes you just gotta take the
take the next step and
see where you land right yeah you have
to re-evaluate as you go
i mean you're not going to have it all
figured out the first day but it's like
you said 80
is good enough so you just have to move
forward you know it's just like
climbing a mountain you literally put
one foot before the other and that's how
you get up
that's awesome you move your foot you
take a breath
you move your other foot you just keep
going yeah well that's really cool well
