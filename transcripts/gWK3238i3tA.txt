the question goes something like this
hey Aaron I'm super interested in
information and guidance you have to
offer I'm wondering if you have any
advice for ptas who are looking to start
a cash business
are we better off becoming certified
personal trainers and get additional
certifications such as assisted stretch
coach to achieve a similar goal I've
been looking at being a trainer or a
stretch coach Etc
