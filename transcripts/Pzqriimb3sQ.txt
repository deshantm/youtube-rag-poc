i'm going to let my platinum mastermind
members teach you what's working
in their businesses in their own words
and how they've implemented
these strategies to accelerate their
business growth and scale their time
income and impact
so you know wherever you are right now
whatever program you're in
with me your ultimate destination is the
platinum mastermind coaching group that
i run
this is where i work together personally
with
passionate physical therapists and
healthcare entrepreneurs
to take their business from 5 000
a month to 20 000 or 22 000 a month
to 64 000 a month or where you're gonna
get
two days off a year or two weeks off a
year
in 80 days off a year
this is the place where you're going to
learn
exactly what you need to do now and over
the next 90 days to 10x
your income and before we even talk
about what that might look for you
i am just uh super excited to share with
you
these six fast cash profit accelerators
that you're going to use and install
them in your business
number one you're going to hear from
elizabeth kennedy and she's going to
teach you
how to run a free total body diagnostic
exam and convert over
95 percent of your prospects to cash
paying patients
even if you're a mobile therapist and
you drive to their home for a free visit
i mean which is incredible to think like
a lot of times you think oh well
you shouldn't be 95 conversion rate but
if you're going to drive to someone's
home as a mobile therapist you want to
be pretty darn
sure that this person is right for you
and this is exactly what you're going to
learn
and then if you move that into your
brick and mortar business
or your business in a gym or any other
business
you're going to be massively successful
and then what you're going to learn
is the next strategy to learn is from
derek nielsen
derek is my private coaching client who
moved to durham north carolina had no
connections
he didn't know any physicians personal
trainers
he didn't have any friends there he just
went with his uh girlfriend
to durham north carolina opened a
cash-based practice and in 12 months he
generated 96
207 dollars he actually did ten thousand
dollars in his first six weeks in his
eighth month
he was doing fifteen thousand dollars
and he did that
without spending any money on ads and
you're going to learn his
marketing strategy that he used to build
relationships in the community and run
workshops to crush it in this business
and then you're going to learn from
preston brown preston brown
came to work with me as like aaron i
want to convert my my business to all
cash practice and i was like well what
are you doing preston he's like well
i'm going into skilled nursing
facilities
and um you know uh
we're the long-term care centers and
working with people
through medicare and medicaid etc i was
like well are you doing well
yes are you making money yes he's like
what do you want
he's like i want more time with my
family so i can coach other physical
therapists to teach him how i
you know grew this business and i was
like great let's do that and over the
course of the year after
enrolling in the platinum mastermind
he's added eight
other employees he scaled his business
he's making money in a cash-based
fitness
online fitness program we built together
and now
he's working on continue to grow that
business while helping other physical
therapists
and from preston you're going to learn
the 90 10 rule
about how to ask the right questions and
follow up
and build relationships so you can 10x
your business too
then you're going to learn from amanda
zariello who
came to me to work together and she was
making about five thousand dollars a
month in the first
few months just through our one required
ethical influence training that all my
platinum master my members are required
to take
she went from 5k a month to 15 000 a
month
and then over the course of the next
eight months we worked together
to build up her systems and grow her
business because she was pregnant
and knew she wanted to take time off
when she had her baby
so we got her to 24 000 a month hired
another pt
and the month she hired the pt which is
in the middle of the pandemic
she had her best month ever in like july
2020
and then she was able to take her
12-week maternity leave
while still running her business and
crushing it so you're going to learn
from her how to leverage free community
events and networking groups to take
your practice from 5k a month to 24k
and then you're going to learn number
five you're going to learn from ben
baghi
and ben is one of um my most successful
platinum mastermind members who
right out of pt school built the cash
practice and made
over six figures in his first year
remember i also did that too but
i didn't make six figures in my first
year
i went right from pt school and now
after years i've downloaded that
information to ben
ben generated six figures this first
year and in the second year
he went from 22 000 a month when he
started the platinum mastermind to 32
in three months and then 10 months later
he was making over 64 000 a month
he took a month to go to southern
california to hang out
and then plan on how
uh plan on like opening a second
location we moved back to iowa
and ben is someone who just crushes it
and takes action
and you're going to learn from ben like
ben's got a massive amount of reviews in
oakland california for his business
and you're going to learn from ben how
to automate your online reviews
whether it's google or yelp or facebook
so you can dominate the local google
search listings and take your clinic
from 20k to 64k a month
and then finally you're going to learn
from alexis sams who is entrepreneur of
the year
in 2020 and pete from pt biz con
and alexis is someone who came to me
doing
part-time home health but she was making
six figures
as a home health therapist so she was
doing part-time working with dancers and
making six figures in home health
and we took her business and grew it so
she could leave a six figure job to grow
her business and travel the country
teaching other dance professionals and
doing private
sessions with with professional dancers
and then during covid we pivoted her to
all online
and you're going to learn from alexis
one of the most important lessons you
can ever learn
it's how to get a massive roi or return
on your investment
by investing in yourself i hope you
enjoy this training
i would love to know your big takeaways
and
uh what you take action on so you can
always just go post that in the group
but enjoy the training and then um
at the end uh we'll wrap it up and uh i
look forward to
seeing you on the next video and
speaking with you very soon
this is where you may want to get some
pen and paper because i'm going to
give it to you everything that i do and
what i want to encourage you is
take the big bullet points and then
later today or this evening
reflect on them and figure out what your
truth is
because my truth may not be your truth
my truth is
people that are trapped in addiction
that are trapped in chronic pain that
are trapped in the mindset of i can't be
anything else um but your truth might be
something different than that you might
work with kids you might work with
athletes and that's okay but you have to
find your own truth
and then apply it to these steps
okay so the first one was i started
speaking to my perfect patient and
jessica
really covered that well um finding out
who they are and so i had my avatar
it was these two women that i was
currently
working with um but what i really
realized
is that my avatar
was people that are hurting and broken
and stuck and
felt bound and like trapped okay
so i started speaking to those people
okay
and it for me it wasn't necessarily
any more oh this is susie and she's 40
years old and she has two kids
i did relate everything back to these
patients but i really said
what is the message that i want to get
across and who do i want to help
because my perfect patient isn't
somebody i've had people tell me this
and this was a
this was a big aha moment for me i went
in and i did one of my free visits and i
asked the
the guy that was sitting in front of me
i said what would it mean to you
to not have to take these pain meds
every day and he said well
nothing i mean like i'm okay taking them
i i won't i won't get addicted to them
it's okay
i don't necessarily not want to take
them
and i told him said i can't help you
then
i said i can only help you if you're
ready to be free of this and so i had to
own that and that was really hard to
walk away from because i want to help
people
right but i had to own that and say
these are the people that i help and if
you don't fit into that mold like
i will continue to talk to you and maybe
you will grow into that but if you can't
fit here
and that's what i would encourage you is
when you're finding your perfect patient
in your avatar
stay specific on them there's a lot of
noise out there and you might feel like
people are passing you by but conversion
relies on you getting the person that
you speak to
in your door or in front of you okay
so the second thing i did was i did a
phone interview
with everyone whether you facebook
messaged me
filled out an online form if you called
my clinic
or my clinic number i obviously did a
phone interview
but no matter what i did not schedule
anyone
without sitting and talking to them on
the phone and this took about 30 minutes
it
still does i still do it takes about 30
minutes
and during this phone conversation
i do ask some questions but i really
just listen
you will be amazed if you just ask
someone you say hey what's your name
um and you say what's going on that you
called me today
or that you wanted my help and
it might be superficial at first i hear
a lot of well i have back pain or i have
i've been told i have a herniated disc
and my next question is always like okay
well what what's that
doing to your life not how bad is your
pain
not what's it what is it at the worst or
the best
or what is it doing to your life how is
this affecting you
and people will start opening up they've
never i won't say never
they rarely have a medical professional
or a doctor ask them this
i hear all the time it's like oh you
actually want to know
yeah i want to know and for about 20
minutes i'll just listen to people
and you just let them talk you're
helping them solve their own problems
you're helping them feel heard
and then that someone out there really
cares about how they feel
at the in it at the end of that phone
conversation i
offer a discovery visit and everyone
gets a free discovery visit everyone
gets a phone call
and everyone gets a free discovery visit
so at the end of my at the phone
conversation i say something along the
lines of
wow that's that's an impactful story i'm
sorry that you're going through that
um i would love to help you and then i
state back whatever their goal is i
would love i had a guy last week he said
i'm really afraid that i'm gonna have to
quit my job
and i have four kids and a wife i said
wow
that must be super stressful for you i'm
sorry that you having to worry about
that right now i would
love to help you feel secure in going
back to work next week
okay what i offer for anyone
that wants my help is a free discovery
visit or if i call it a total body
diagnostic assessment
so what i offer for anybody who wants my
help is a free
total body diagnostic assessment and
most people
well everyone's like oh that sounds
great there are a lot of people that are
like that's fine i want the eval though
like i if you give me an email and i say
yeah i'll give you an eval but we're
going to start with this total body
diagnostic assessment
it is no commitment and no cost and i
did this
even when i was going into people's
homes and i have so many people ask me
they're like
you went and spent 30 minutes on the
phone and in 30 minutes and someone's
helped you spend an hour of your time
and you didn't know if you were gonna
make a penny
yeah because my why is helping people
break free of chains
it's not making a hundred dollars an
hour or two hundred dollars an hour or
three hundred dollars an hour
it's helping people break for your
trains and if i stay authentic to that
then my actions will guide me so
i go in and or now people come to me
um but i would go into someone's home
and during
that phone interview i would either have
my notebook and i'd be writing or if i
was sitting at my computer i would be
typing
because again i'm not really talking a
lot they're telling me their whole story
and i'm typing it out
and i'd go to this discovery visit and i
would have the subjective portion
of my eval template filled out with
their story
and i'd say hey uh mrs jones um
so nice to meet you i'm so glad that we
get this opportunity to sit down
together and see
if we can get you and i would repeat
their goal back to them
my goal today is to help you reach your
goals
okay but what i want to do first before
we do anything
else is i want to go over what you told
me on the phone i want to make sure that
i understand what you told me and that i
didn't misinterpret anything
or maybe there's some more information
that you remember now
that you didn't tell me then that you
can fill in the gaps
and so i say i have my notes here i'm
just going to kind of go through what i
recall
and i tell them their phone conversation
their story
back to them and you will not believe
how many people
sit in front of me and they're like you
actually listened when i was talking
like people tell me that and i'm like
well yeah yeah i listened to you
wow okay um yeah that's pretty much
that's pretty much my story right now
can you help me
and then i take them through a brief
movement assessment
and the the total body diagnostic
assessment or the discovery vision
discovery visit portion of
um visit okay and i give them all the
information
literally everything i can i do i don't
usually do
anything hands-on if someone for example
if someone comes to me say with a
shoulder pain um and they're like yeah i
think maybe i tore my rotator cuff or
they tell me i have to have surgery
i might do some special tests of the
rotator cuff where i will put my hands
on them there
um but i don't do any treatment or any
manipulation or anything like that it's
it's really i will touch them and say
okay it hurts here because touch is so
powerful
and then at that at the end after we've
re-gone over their story and i've
watched the move and done a couple of
just very basic testing for what they're
coming in for
i'll sit down with them and educate them
about exactly what i think is going on
exactly what i'm going to do to fix it
and a timeline
and i'll ask them if they want to move
forward and
a hundred percent of the time it's yes
and by move forward and i explain to
them move forward means today that i
will give you a treatment
so we will do a brief treatment session
and you will walk away with
three exercises to incorporate this week
and a plan moving forward
that's my conversion from a discovery
visit to an evo
which in the last nine months has been a
hundred percent
okay then
at the end of the eval i say okay
so we finished the eval here's your plan
okay
this is what we're going to do to get
started and this is what i recommend for
you
i tell them like to meet your goals and
do x
it's going to take x and i only sell in
programs that's going to be my complete
pt program
and it's a health investment of fifteen
hundred dollars i can't even think of my
prices right now but health investment
of fifteen hundred dollars
and just like many of you i'm sure i'll
get the
oh i don't know okay
um i want to do that um okay i say
here's the deal i do have some people
paying full up front
and if that's something that you want to
do um i do
offer a 10 discount for programs that
are paid in full
but then i offer them something else and
this i truly believe
is where my 90 to 95
conversion rate for from an eval to
programs
comes in because if i go back to my
authenticity
i believe in financial freedom okay
i believe that finances bind us way more
than we'd like to admit
i also believe that people need help
and gosh darn it if i can't help you
because you can't afford it
like that hurts me literally that
i just that is something that i have a
really hard time reconciling
is people that truly need help
but aren't getting the help they need
because they don't have the means or the
resources
and especially in an opioid crisis or an
addiction crisis
or a mom that came to me and said i
tried to commit suicide last week
like i'll be darned if your kids don't
get their mom for the rest of their life
because you can't afford it
so that's where i offer a payment plan
and it's not a three-month payment plan
it's not a six-month payment plan it's
not a nine-month payment plan
i literally tell them i say okay you
have the option to pay in full
but here's the deal i don't want you to
walk out of here not getting the help
you need
to not live a life of freedom that you
deserve that your kids deserve that your
husband or your wife deserves that your
employer deserves but that you deserve
to
so here's the deal i offer a payment
plan
it's all about you everything i do in
this clinic
is all about you it's all about my
patients i'm here to serve you
and here's the options you can choose
weekly bi-weekly or monthly and you tell
me how much
and we will make it work the only thing
i ask
is that it is paid off within 12 months
365 days
of this date and that you have a card on
file and you do it via auto draft
because you may be paying after your
program is over
95 of the time and there are a couple
people that'll walk away
and um two weeks ago i had someone
and i honestly think that it was a
spousal thing there
of a different um culture
whatever um so there are a few
but generally i've now taken down all
the barriers right that's what we're
doing as healthcare providers is we're
breaking down barriers
there is no reason to say no at this
point
and so they say yes and they opt in
and i it's funny because i was talking
my mom is my cpa
and i was talking to her um earlier this
week
about finances and what's going on now
and i don't have people walking in my
door right now
and i'm not worried about it i'm still
able to put content out
i'm still answering the phone i'm
answering my clients and i
i'd be lying if i said like oh i didn't
have a little bit of stress
because i don't have clients coming in
my door but i've built my business on
financial freedom
and so i'm not stressing about how i'm
going to pay my bills this month
and that is one of the reasons i started
as a mobile therapist
i started with a thousand dollars in my
pocket
and i said i will grow my business as i
have the means
to grow my business and it might be a
little slower
but at least i know that i can talk
authentically to people because when
someone comes in my door
i'm not worried about oh am i going to
get 197
for the eval am i going to get a
thousand dollars like can i get them in
a program
i literally want to help them and i'm
able to help them truly and
authentically because myself
i'm financially free and offering them
financial freedom
so the first thing that i struggled with
was okay how do i get leads how do i get
people and
get myself in front of people because i
don't again i didn't know anybody
and i didn't have money for marketing i
don't have money for facebook ads
google i don't have money for anything
um so how do i get leads what and that's
what
the uh exercises aaron had everybody to
do like where's your perfect patient
and just you know he already went
through all of this and so
it mine was was going out and reaching
out to the gym
i went to some group meetups like
meetup.com type stuff it didn't work out
for me
there was many times that i went and met
people
that didn't work out but there's a few
times it dirt worked out and it worked
out really well
so you will have if you're like me
you're gonna have a lot of these
meetings with people that just isn't
gonna turn it into anything
but then you're gonna have a select few
that it's like holy that just made
my
six months um and so you want to
continue to nurture those relationships
and make sure you hold on to the good
ones because there's going to be a lot
more that don't work out than do
but i had the most success at a
kettlebell gym
that's fairly close to me uh she let me
go in there and do some workshops
movement screen type stuff
and then just like aaron i met uh burn
boot camp for the record i met them
first
uh burned boot camp and that worked out
for me and i'm still getting patience
from that
and i haven't been there for months um
and then i
did reach out to other health care
providers so i would recommend find
somebody that's a physician assistant
that owns their own clinic
she sent me eight ten patients i haven't
had one for a while
but physician assistant that owns her
own clinic is a great person to reach
out to
chiropractors are great people to reach
out to the ones that do a crack you
incendia
they're looking for somebody like us
because there's they know they can't be
a solution for people that have more the
chronic pain to have
more soft tissue type issues they're
looking for somebody so reach out to
chiropractors
i reached out to dietitian it was
actually a weight loss md it hasn't
turned into anything but the
the relationships there uh i reached out
to a direct primary care physician
that's another one
everybody should look into because they
are cash based uh physicians
uh and there's a possibility she hasn't
sent me anybody either but
it's still the relationship is there
building relationships is a big concept
applying um and then this is number
two factor of or the key but um applying
things like sales principles uh to our
relationships i want you to
stay connected uh and follow up with
people
and then be consistent and communicate
so
let's go through that so with applying
um sales principles to relationships
one of the things i've started doing is
i started using a 9010 rule
and this 9010 rule is pretty cool um
what you do is you think about 90
of the conversation so you're building a
relationship you're talking to someone
they're talking and 90 of the time
um while or the 10 percent that you
speak
you're asking questions about the thing
that you're
wanting to know about so this could be
an evaluation this could be
a person you're meeting for the first
time at a networking event
but you want them to speak 90 percent of
the time
and 10 percent of the time you're asking
questions it's it's
challenging um but that's a good way to
build relationships because they're
talking about themselves you're learning
more about them
and also to your uh you're listening and
that's a big factor with building a
relationship
the other thing is is when you're doing
meetings um you want to
mirror the person's body language you
want to
do these little soft skills um think
about um
you know don't all right and don't be
creepy
that's another thing don't be a creeper
um
you want to you know make eye contact um
there's like this uh concept of looking
you know one eye it for 10 to 15 seconds
the other eye 10 to 15 seconds their
mouth
10 to 15 seconds um you know they call
it the inverted triangle
this isn't pelvic health but uh you're
looking you know what
but you're not necessarily uh being
creepy about it
okay um because no one likes creepy
social distancing
right think about that because that is
um
important some people don't like you all
in their space and that's okay
to to to be aware of that the other
thing too is you want to
follow up or build some type of
connection
with them so i use email follow-ups
i use phone calls i use check-ins one
thing aaron taught me
is to write a handwritten letter lumpy
mail put something in that letter
um i actually got a call back on that um
friday or yesterday actually they left a
message and said hey thanks for the
letter that's pretty cool you know
thanks for the gift
it's just a little something a little
small but lumpy mail is like
putting like a pen or putting some type
of object inside of the letter
because then when they get it it's like
it has some density to it
um the other thing is consistency and
communication so making sure that
you are staying consistent on schedule
making sure that you're um um you know
doing things
i like to uh do things like make a call
or
text during my down time or when i'm
driving uh
never to continue um with conversation
like where it where it ended because uh
finding out someone's
you know frustration what they want to
achieve you just keep talking about that
and that's what you got to do i just
started to get out into the community
and just do events like having a table
not even workshops yet
but i was taught like how to utilize
that so like collect emails like it's
all about collecting
information so you have contacts to
reach out to them
so i i signed up for this golf event and
i put some materials together with how
to prevent low back pain
and golfers collected emails did a
raffle and i got one patient out of it
that
bought full like 10 package plan of care
so that paid for itself
um i also did a couple health fairs and
the same
model was like just collecting emails um
and i would have small talk with people
that i did
meet and like whatever issues came up
like with back pain shoulder like write
a note down
and so i remember if i go email them i
can like talk about what they were
talking to me about because otherwise i
would have forgotten
um so getting in the community was huge
um another thing with community is i'm a
part of what's called
bni business networking international
and
i joined that i've been in it for two
years
and it's helped me tremendously and
those of you who don't know it's
basically a group you meet with once a
week
that has um all different professionals
so like one pt one lawyer one realtor
one
physical trainer and you just build
relationships you ask for referrals you
help each other grow and so that has
made me like this this past
quarter like i made six thousand dollars
from referrals from that room and
taught it it cost like 800 to for the
year
so there's a lot of different groups and
if you want to try it i would recommend
going to different ones because they're
not all great and you want to find
that's a good match but
it's another way to get out in the
community um
so with the emails i learned like the
holiday emailing
so i don't know if i learned that
mastermind or with aaron
one of his trainings and buy one get one
so i did a few email series with that
to try to get more income
and that i made about 1200 with that
for black friday deals and i also
started to try to grow my google account
so or google reviews
and that was i wrote an email that said
can you do me a favor like that was like
in my
subject line and when you ask for favors
people are like more likely to help you
out
and i think a sales person taught me
that a while ago so
um so then i got like 25 google reviews
so that's just one thing i implemented
um uh
and then i started doing like just
recently like a core class at the gym
um just another way for people to
educate people and
get to know people but this this group
helped me kind of figure out like how do
i utilize it even more so like offer
maybe
a hundred dollars off a discovery or an
evaluation
you know if there's an injury so actual
stuff that you guys can do
is come up with a good process of
collecting reviews
on yeop and google um one thing that we
do is
i have we aaron's done a good job of
helping with me with this
on the evaluation we pre-frame it be
like hey miss smith if we can get you
back to
x y and z the only favor i have in
return is you share your story once
we're able to do that and so other
people like you can get the help that
they need
um and then at the end of the planet uh
towards like threesome when they have
about three sessions left and they've
met a lot of their goals or they've
stated they've been really happy with
their progress
you say hey miss smith i know i know i
don't know if you remember but during
the evaluation
i asked the only favor would be that you
leave a review for us
um i'm super happy that you're happy
with your with your care and the
products that you made
i think you have an awesome story would
you be willing to share that with
with um other people on google and yelp
and tell your story because it's going
to help other people just like you
find the help that they need this is
especially important if somebody's been
to like other practitioners and
this they've been dealing with this for
like two or three years or you know over
a decade
and they just have a hard time finding
the right person like
by ms smith by sharing your story you're
gonna help somebody else bypass all that
and find the help that they need right
away
what i'll be would you be open to doing
this most time they're like yeah i'm
super
be super excited to do that for you guys
and i'm happy to do that however
it takes time to follow up with those
people like they need their
they will they say they're going to do
it and then they need some
kind of like prodding and getting them
to reminders to do it
it's not because they don't want to do
assists they're busy it's they forget
about what we do
after the initial evaluation or sorry
not initially evaluation but after that
session
we send them the links to both our to
our yelp google and facebook and
statement smith all you have to do is
copy and paste your story into each
platform and get that posted
and we'd really appreciate it um and
kind of reiterate the importance of
sharing their story and and how
appreciative we are of it and letting
them like hey
we don't get referrals from physicians
either um
and we are largely based on the results
that we get with patients
and so by you sharing your story it
helps us as a clinic as well so that's a
tip that we
throw in the email as well the reason
the end of the planet care
is because a lot of times people need
reminders so next time you come in we
make a note in our documentation that
hey we asked for
we asked mrs smith for uh a review um
last session if they haven't done it
make sure we might not and so sometimes
people need two or three reminders
and to do it so that's something we've
been doing that's really helped us rank
higher on yelp and google and produce
these organic leads
without having to do so much ground work
the first thing that i learned
is the concept of return on investment
it is an active process when you're an
entrepreneur and the emphasis is on the
word active
when i thought of in the word investment
and especially return on investment
all i knew before being in the
mastermind program and working with this
community of individuals
all i knew was like investment meant
like stocks and bonds
you know you like have some money and
you like give it to a stock broker you
invest it
and then they do stuff with it and then
your money grows
which when you think about it is a very
passive approach all you had to do was
like give the stock broker money they
probably do some stuff but
and you may or may not be involved in
those things that you do or
that those things that they do but all
you really do is just give the money
for what i understand that was kind of
my understanding or my only
concept or foundation for the term
investment
but what i've learned is return on
active process
it's up to me to get my return on my
investment
like my investment um is directly
proportional to the amount of work i put
into
what i've invested in um some of you may
have heard me talk about
the recent open house event that i had
in 2018 and i put it in air quotes
because the next time i do it
i'm not even going to call it an open
house because at the end of the day
giving your clients what they want
they don't really care what your house
looks like they don't care
that my walls are white or what color
you know my posters are or my what my
pictures look like
you know they want me to get them better
um so moving forward into a community
event i'm going to position it
and offer it more as a way to help my
community
that point being uh that point aside
um i invested or i thought i invested
um a little over i don't know
maybe like a thousand dollars a little
over a thousand um
in facebook like marketing and like kind
of advertisements
um and i was like okay so
if i get you know somebody gets a uh
allows me to help them in in working on
a program or you know they buy one of my
programs
then you know i will have a good return
on my investment
that's not how it is that can be
a that can be a good outcome
we want that outcome but getting that
result
is not just because i did facebook and
had the and had the event
um i got out there and i talked to
people
um i followed up with people i could
have followed up
better with people um i did collect
emails
and i did do some um email automation
but i could have done better on that to
get an even better return on my
investment
i could have offered an additional
follow-up event to get more people
interested
i did tap into a whole new group of
um a dance community i got like a lot of
irish dancers who actually came to that
event
um that allowed me to reach out to some
irish dance companies and start having
conversations
with those companies and let them know
what i can do for their dancers and
their performers
so being active in what i already
invested
into helped my success
oh man wasn't that awesome those are
some amazing
fast cash profit accelerators now it's
your turn to go install these in your
business
and if you'd like to get some results
just like these amazing people like
elizabeth
derrick preston amanda ben or even
alexis
or marcy and julie and amanda
and elizabeth or
jennifer i mean people like you
who once thought that this wasn't
possible but now
you can see how ordinary passionate
physical therapists just like you can
achieve
massive success and results by just
taking action
on the one or two things that you know
are going to
give you a 10x result and the way that
these guys have done that
is by working together with me in the
platinum mastermind group that i run
and what we do is not just give you a
bunch of courses and information is we
sit down together and help you figure
out exactly where you are
right now in this moment in time and
then
we get to spend some time with you
getting clarity on your goals so what's
your 90 day goal what's your
one year goal and your three-year goal
and then we give you a 90-day action
plan to crush it
and actually in the platinum mastermind
we do this three times a year
in our two day mastermind retreats so
we're going to start off with that
and give you a 90 day action plan and
then we're going to meet
over the course of a year three times
and my most successful
mastermind members actually work with me
over
multiple years and so what i'd love to
do is invite you
to a free strategy and scale session
and in this free call
what we're going to do is just get to
know you and then we're going to
help you get clarity on your goals by
asking you some questions this is a
free like vision is almost like a vision
goal setting workshop
that we do together and then if at the
end of the call we feel good about
working together and we feel like we can
actually help you achieve your goals and
you'd like to work
together with us personally we'll invite
you into the platinum mastermind
and we'll talk about how that works on
the call but in the meantime what i'd
love for you to do is go to the link
below

business assessment and application
and schedule a time to get on a call
with me or my team
and we'll get on that call we'll figure
out where you are where you want to go
and give you an action
plan and a 90-day strategy and
we're going to crush it together because
all we're doing is working to save 100
million people from unnecessary surgery
and i can't do that alone i need
passionate
action takers just like you who are
ready to go after it and help people get
exactly what they need which we all know
is physical therapy and assessment by a
skilled physical therapist
so they can avoid pain meds injections
and surgery
