mission to share a passion for travel
therapy jess
is uh helping people become travelers
you know what she's doing she's helping

do what everyone says they shouldn't do
she's doing amazing things herself um
selling courses online helping other
physical therapists grow even during
a pandemic in these uncertain times so
jess is a badass entrepreneur and she
um is here to share what's up so jess
thanks for being here today
thank you so much for having me aaron
this is an honor
yeah it's awesome but it's been awesome
to see some of the things that you've
been doing this year and
how you're helping people and taking
action so can you
uh just share a little bit about um
what do you do right now because you're
doing a couple different things they're
like who are you helping what are you
doing
and uh we'll start there okay sounds
good
um yeah so like you said i've been a
traveling pt for 10 years
and after a couple of years being a
traveler i had a lot of people
asking me like how to do it how to find
housing what companies to work with and
i realized that this
wealth of knowledge that i had gained
was really
valuable and i needed to share it with
people so i thought at first like oh
i'll just write a book about travel pt
and then i quickly realized like
no this needs to be a blog and like
accessible to everybody so
um i came up with the name pts and i
threw it into a blog
and now it has webinars online courses
a lot of different resources for
travelers and especially helping new
grads become travel therapists because
a lot of new grads will hear like oh
well don't be a traveler as a new grad
um you have to gain experience first and
that is absolutely not the case so
um i started there with wanderlust pts
and then covid hit and a lot of people
got let go from their jobs uh so
i decided like i wanted to inspire other
people
to take control of their career i saw
what wanderlust pts did for me
and having an online business uh did for
me so i wanted to
empower and inspire other pts to do the
same and start building
um online businesses for themselves in
virtual clinics and so that's what i'm
doing now in addition to health coach
traveling therapists is
uh helping try travel therapists but
also
uh any pts who are interested in
learning how to start and grow an online
business
that's awesome so how did you like so
how ten years ago how did you get into
pt like what was the reason you stepped
into physical therapy
versus well let's say business
consulting or
i mean you know like back in that is
like working for arthur anderson or
becoming a lawyer and
you know whatever like how did you
choose physical therapy
yeah i wish that it was a great like
story but it's not it was uh just hey
i like working with people i think the
human body is
incredible i like to know all pieces and
parts of it
it's it wasn't just um that i had an
injury and i went to pt and i said oh
this is great
i wanted to help people but i didn't
want to be on call like a doctor was so
i figured physical therapy fit the bill
i could go to school i could do this i
would i thought
i would always have a job right we all
thought that going into pt school we'll
always have a job we'll always be
needed somewhere um which is the case
there are still patients out there
even though uh covid has affected the
job market
so um yeah it's it's nothing really
exciting
yeah other than that how did you
like how did you get into travel pt was
it something that you did right away
after you graduated or
um you know was it something you did
after a few years of working
you know so yeah i i worked um
for one year at a clinic where i was the
only pt but i had a mentor
who owned the clinic who helped me to
learn what it was like to
start run and grow an outpatient clinic
on my own so that was that was amazing
um but then i actually the truth is
honestly i
didn't want to travel initially i was
scared i was rather a homebody
i didn't like change i didn't um i
didn't want to step outside of my
comfort zone and i didn't want to travel
but my partner at the time really wanted
to travel and said look let's just try
it for 13 weeks
if we like it we'll keep going if we
hate it we can come home nothing lost
right um so that is what i did i didn't
want to travel but i tried it
and it was the best decision i ever made
like it's
been amazing the um travel pt isn't just
about like the career but it's about
the opportunity that it gives you to
achieve the goals
that you set for yourself as far as
financial goals personal goals
being able to take time off and see
places that you want to see
meeting new people um so but that you
don't realize
until you step outside of your comfort
zone and you give it a try
yeah wow that's awesome so
what what is it like is it is it that
you can work for 13 weeks and take
two months off and just chill i mean
what is it about traveling and seeing
like
going around and doing that like that
what convince me why i should be doing
it
why should you be a traveling therapist
yeah so there's the obvious see new
places right so
um travel therapy is basically what it
is is it's when a
um a facility like an outpatient clinic
a hospital system home health company
needs temporary staff and hires
a recruiting company or an intermediate
agency to help place staff just for a
temporary need
the benefits of it are that you can go
to new places see new
places work there temporarily and see if
you like it
and in fact 80 to 90 percent of these
jobs that are available are actually
seeking permanent staff but for one
reason or another
they can't find permanent staff quickly
enough so that's why they hire
the travel therapist just as temporary
because in the meantime they're looking
for permanent staff
so that's something to realize is new
grads
as a new grad 80 to 90 percent of these
jobs are looking for permanent staff so
if you were to move to the area and
apply for a permanent position
it's the same job there's nothing
different about that travel job
so that aside the benefits of seeing new
places meeting new people
right the people that you meet with are
going that you work with
become your new friends these new
friends introduce you to
new hobbies and new experiences that you
might not have otherwise
um experienced so things like yoga
i've never had attempted yoga and then
some friends
inspired us to do that hiking
camping things i've never done before
never visited a
national park until some friends were
like hey we should go do this and then
before you know it i've
hit 21 of 62. um wow
yeah so new places so it's not like
these aren't like
crappy jobs that no one wants you know
which is the
which is the idea placed in my head when
i was like right
yeah and now not every job is right for
a new grad and not every job
is a good job like yes there are crappy
jobs out there
the important part is that you do your
research you ask the right questions on
the interview
to paint a picture of exactly what it is
you're getting into
so asking about mentorship support staff
other pts there what the onboarding
process looks like productivity
and getting the specifics of it so that
you're no rock is left unturned you're
not making any assumptions so that when
you go there you know what you've gotten
yourself into
um people get in trouble and i think you
hear a lot of horror stories about
travel therapy
is when people just sign up and make
those assumptions and then
show up there and that's what i did for
my first travel job
you know they they told us what the
productivity was
and i didn't know what that answer meant
i didn't understand what the answer
meant i asked the right question
i got the answer but i didn't understand
what that meant
and because i didn't have anybody
coaching me or telling me
you know what was good or bad um got
ourselves into a
tight position that was a little bit
uncomfortable what happened
like what was it what was it it was a
skilled nursing facility and they were
looking for like a 90
productivity uh and sharing computers
so you know you couldn't do point of
care documentation
and for me who had worked in an
outpatient clinic seeing
by myself seeing 16 to 20 patients a day
doing paper documentation i thought oh
well my productivity is
easily 90 percent like no big deal well
you can't compare
outpatient productivity to skilled
nursing productivity especially when you
can't find a blood pressure cuff that
works or you have to share a computer
or this person is toileting right now
and you can't get them right or you have
to walk between
so um anyway i knew the question to ask
but i didn't understand what
that meant and that's why having um
having somebody to coach you through it
and having mentorship through your
process of becoming a traveling
therapist
is really important yeah what are some
of the other like pitfalls or traps that
people fall into like
especially if they just flip to the back
of the magazine and just
choose the number and call i don't know
i mean that was what i saw i was like
just
the ads exactly right what kind of
problems should we look out for yeah so
um don't go with just any recruiting
company
or any recruiter uh
definitely be go with recruiters and
companies that are recommended and
recommended from people who have been
doing it for a while
who know what to look out for um some
companies and
recruiters don't try to take advantage
of you but they don't know better
and so as a result it puts you in a bad
situation
um so i would say go with recruiters and
companies from people who are
have been doing it and know what to look
out for that's probably one thing
um other things are
know what questions to ask on the
interview so that you can find yourself
a good fit for yourself
and then there's also a systematic way
of doing things as a traveler so
for example um and you live and you
learn and i
learn from all of these mistakes and
that's why i'm happy to share it with
everybody and
like needed to throw it up on a blog but
for example um
housing don't sign your housing
contract until you get there and you
know you have a job
or make sure you do a little bit of
research on what the housing market is
like
before you sign that contract and this
is the example
naples florida in the winter beautiful
job
amazing area um great
clients it's probably one of the
wealthiest places in the nation
and has beautiful weather for the winter
right so
we sign a contract and we we sign a
contract and then we start looking for
housing and we realize
all of the snowbirds go to naples
florida and there is no short-term
housing
that is under say 2500 a month in the
area so that was a whoopsie daisies
um that i now coach people into doing
you know make sure you understand what
the housing market is like before you
sign a contract oh because you're not
getting paid enough to afford the
housing
uh you are but if you
you know if you had the opportunity to
take a job
that pays two thousand dollars where the
housing
costs twelve hundred dollars you know if
finances are important for you
you would take that into consideration
versus getting paid fifteen hundred
dollars a week
where the housing was you know twenty
five hundred dollars a month
um so just understanding what you're
getting into before you sign that
contract yeah
yeah no that's awesome that's a great
point what
uh what is the like craziest thing that
you've seen or experienced um
traveling around the us or working as a
people
craziest thing um i think okay so i'm
going to go to naples and say because
you had said you know when i think of
travel jobs i think of like these crappy
jobs right
um i think one of my favorite stories to
tell
is showing up at naple in the naples
florida
job and we worked as
pts for a
private like golf club slash tennis
so very active outdoor within a gym
and you walked in and there were like
waterfalls
and marble and it was just this
beautiful gym space and it was a dream
come true for any physical therapist and
it
palm trees outside it looked over the
pool and
um so that is probably one of the
nicest most relaxing jobs that we had uh
as as travelers um so it wasn't like
crazy in a bad way
but it was like you couldn't believe
yourself your jaw just dropped open like
i get to work here for the next
13 weeks um or more when it's snowing up
in buffalo and here we are down in
florida cool did you get like you know
to go to the jacuzzi and hot tub and all
the spa services like
on your time off there uh i wish we
could
um but no but we did eat lunch out at
the pool area right so it's like lunch
time and you got to go sit out and eat
at the pool
and enjoy the sunshine yeah i had a job
um as a massage therapist working at the
sycamore middle springs hot springs and
spa in california
and if someone was a no-show we got to
go in the red
redwood hot tubs with the you know in
the sulfur water just gonna chill out
for like an hour it was
awesome that's amazing yeah it was great
amazing so what um
what are some of the things like you
said uh like the questions people ask or
like if someone wants to do a traveler
what are like the one or two things they
need to
um ask or find out or where do they like
what would be
like the the places they should go to
get the information like where's the
right
travel companies or recruiters you know
what are the what are the top three tips
like what what goes on your like
checklist
on my checklist yeah um so i said
definitely go with
somebody who's recommended i recommend
if you want to be connected to those
people who i
recommend you can go to
wunderlustpts.com forward slash
recruiter
and be connected with those people but
when it comes to
how do you find a good recruiter or
company you want to make sure that they
are communicative and adhere to
what you're looking for in a job but are
not
pushy about it um so you don't want them
to say things like
uh well skilled nursing is really good
for a new grad or you should work in
xyz because they don't know your
experience they don't know what you're
comfortable with
um so make sure that they're not pushy
make sure that they are respectful
of of what you're looking for but are
also very honest about the market
so for example kovid has really affected
the market
pre-covered the job market might have
hovered around 100 maybe 70 to 100 pt
jobs in the nation at any given time
like open and available
yeah open and available pt job travel pt
jobs across the nation about 70 to
100-ish
um and then postcovid like
worst time ever i think there were maybe
five to seven
available and not only that the market
was flooded with pts not just travel pts
but perm pt's too
so it was almost impossible to to find
travel jobs at that time luckily though
the market is bouncing back and right
now there are
maybe about 50 pt jobs so i'd say we're
like 50
there um in recovering from
covet as far as the market goes but um
you want them to be honest
about that for context like if there's a
hundred open jobs how many
jobs are there being filled like how
many physical therapists are working as
travelers do you know
oh i don't know that i could just tell
you you know how many jobs are available
at any given time but i don't know how
many are
actually um significantly less than
nurses i know travel nursing is very
popular
but um yeah i don't know that answer
yeah that's awesome
yeah cool yeah i'd love to know um
what are some of the uh you know new
right new grads are told not to
do travel they're also told not to open
a business they're told not to do a lot
of things
let's talk about that i was one of those
people that was told
like you're crazy you need five years of
experience to open a business and i was
like
you don't even know me you know um
like what are your thoughts on that yeah
um i
well new grads i've coached hundreds of
new grads to be traveling therapists so
that like just debunks that right away
they're told that because people
have horror stories or they've heard of
horror stories
my first question is has that person
ever traveled before have they traveled
and likely
the answer is no like they probably have
never been a traveling therapist they've
just heard of horror stories and that
people should get experience
but like i said 80 to 90 of these travel
jobs are seeking permanent staff they're
the same jobs that you'd be applying for
and then on top of that not every job is
right for new grad travel or perm so
find out asking the right questions on
the interview to know if it's the right
job for you
um but besides that i think that there's
something called imposter syndrome
that just sits not only as travelers but
also just in the pt
as pts graduate from school and across
the board right people can have imposter
syndrome in any kind of career
um but imposter syndrome is your fear of
being
found out as a fraud right um i think
that we as pts need to
overcome that imposter syndrome even as
new grads and know that we can help
people
and if we can't help people what will we
do
and do you have a mentor are you
are you taking continuing education to
continue um
to grow as a clinician so
i think that like dentists and
chiropractors
they open businesses right out of school
do they not
right so why are you sort of massage
therapist too i mean
yeah you know yeah exactly um so why is
it
why do we come out of school as pts
thinking like oh well i can't do that
i'm a new grad
well you absolutely can you just went to
school for this
yeah someone's telling you you can't
yeah
right yeah what um so tell me more like
imposter syndrome right
like talk more about it like where have
you struggled with that
uh right now i'm struggling with it just
being on this podcast like to be
completely vulnerable
um yes i've been a travel pt for 10
years and i still
for some reason feel this sense of like
well why am i the person
that is here talking to everybody about
travel pt
well because i do know my stuff for lack
of a better word um
but it it just i don't it still gets to
you um
whether you're you know in it as a new
grad or
doing it for 10 years yeah oh yeah i
mean
i i uh often i'm like
am i really like do i really know what
i'm talking about because
you know like i have no control over
what everyone does but
you know and then i was just telling um
my wife this morning i was like but
uh you know jess and ben julian all
these other people are crushing it this
year
and you know i'm like but you know
there's a lot of
there's a lot of doubt like our brains
are wired for that wouldn't you agree
yeah oh absolutely and why like yeah i
think it
helps to have a coach to um like
yourself
to help talk yourself through it and
step outside of your comfort zone
because
that is where the growth happens and if
you just stay in your head and
stick with that imposter syndrome you're
never going to grow beyond that
yeah and i think starting before you're
ready is another
is another way you're never going to
feel ready regarding anything in life
let alone opening a business so
start before you're ready and get
outside of your comfort zone and that's
how you grow
so what would be something that someone
has to do if they're like okay
i'm not ready yet i don't feel ready yet
but jess just told me i have to start
like how do they
like what's what's the first thing to do
whether it's travel or starting a
business or just doing something you
want to do like what's that
first step um in my opinion it's get a
mentor
and invest in yourself um and that's
because
the mentor can see from a bird's-eye
view basically where you are
in the forest what path you need to take
and how best to get there
sometimes when you're in it yourself
you're looking around but you don't
really there's just so much to do so
many options you don't know which which
way is the best
regarding whether it's travel pt or
starting your own business or anything
in life
so if you get somebody who's been there
and done that before
it's a lot easier it saves you time
and um and don't be afraid to invest in
yourself
i started when i started wanderlust pts
in 2016
i started with an online course about
blogging
and helping to turn a blog into a
business and that online course
was a couple thousand dollars but it has
helped me
it it has returned on my investment
tenfold um
and because it did that i was uh
i was quick to invest again and take
classes on
webinar creation online courses
copywriting
telehealth cash pt um and you find time
after time again
if you do the work and if you are ready
to commit and invest in yourself
that that investment returns tenfold
each time if it's a good investment for
you it will return tenfold and you have
to do the work
so i would say that get a mentor don't
be afraid to step outside of your
comfort zone
and invest in yourself take that first
step
that's awesome and then the second step
is once you
invest and take uh and learn something
then what's the
what's the next thing you have to do
take action yeah
is that the answer yes
take action like what does that mean to
you take action i mean you know aaron
said
jess just said take action what is that
what does that mean take action
i think it's um that's where we're
stepping outside of the comfort zone
starts
and i know you know i have a list of of
things to do to take action
um but a lot of those things are a lot
more uncomfortable than others
and sometimes you'll sit in the the
comfortable space but it's when you take
action
in the uncomfortable space that you see
results yeah
yeah well you do that like i don't like
you're like aaron i got this question
and i'll answer it and
next thing i know you've done it and
more i'm like holy cow she just does it
which is great
well thank you i would attribute that um
you know when you said take action and
step outside of your comfort zone
there's been so many times you've been
like jess
this is what you need to do next i'm
like but aaron
and you're like it's what you need to do
and then i would do it
and then um it it's very
it's very helpful and then it pays off
it pays off is the right word yeah
exactly yeah it's um and i've found
you know that taking like i've gotten
into a pattern of
i know what i need to do and i just like
boom do it
but i was i didn't know what to do for a
long time and i found a lot of people
get
stuck you know have you gotten stuck
with not knowing what to do or
not like what is that feeling like for
people
if you can describe it of like not
knowing what to do so you don't
take action versus knowing what to do
and you do take action can you
absolutely yeah um
you're as an entrepreneur your to-do
list is endless
it's always endless there's always going
to be things to do
and at times you're going to feel
overwhelmed to just not do any of them
but when you get on a coaching call
with your mentor or
that's when the clarity comes of okay
this is what i need to do first this is
why i need to do it in order to take the
next step in my business
whereas if you don't have somebody like
i said with that bird's eye view that
can say hey go
do this uh you're gonna get you're gonna
stay stuck in that place of like well i
don't know what to do next or i don't
know what makes sense or you're gonna be
spinning your wheels doing things
that don't matter little things that
aren't going to make a difference
you have to instead invest your time in
what's going to move
the needle is that what you say what
what moves the needle the furthest
yeah what moves the knee or what's the
lever that you can pull that gets the
biggest result
right right yeah and i think it's um you
know
right when it comes to physical therapy
we all know how to treat people and we
all know how to like diagnose them and
like oh i can i think i can help you
move
with less pain or with whatever the
result is um but in business sometimes
there's a lot of great ideas and we
don't know where to okay which path to
go down
yeah um yeah that's great thanks for
sharing your
your your perspective on that because i
think it's good for people to hear
because like
you know like i needed to hear that for
a long time myself
um and it's true true for anything i
mean online business
um anything anything you want to learn
yeah like buying a van and traveling
around the united states
so uh yes self um development anything
like that yeah
so i do have a van and uh it's a it's
converted
and right i mean you could build the van
without knowing anything and you could
try to figure it all out for yourself
take
10 times as long and you could
you know spend a lot more money or you
could just
get advice from somebody who's been
there and done that and build exactly
what you want the first time
with exactly what you need and i mean
i'm uh you get what you pay for kind of
person
and as long as you can invest in
yourself and take action and do the work
you're going to see a return that's
awesome so what kind of van do you have
it's like a
it's like a dodge or something like that
right
yeah it's a promaster ram
um 2015
high roof extended cab 3500.
that's cool so what is everything i need
inside yeah so did you build it out do
you have someone else build it out you
buy it that way
i built it out with uh some friends and
assistants
yes so it was it was fun it was neat to
like
learn all of the insulation and the
wiring and
batteries and just kind of design what
you want
um so that was that was really fun again
people who i met traveling
inspired us to do this so that's awesome
and you
currently use it to travel around to
different places and
or you were doing it for your travel
jobs were you using your van to drive
around the country for it
i was using it between assignments using
it as i take
um you had asked like can you just take
two months off and the answer is yes you
don't get paid for your time off in
between assignments um
but you have the flexibility of being
like you know what i'm just gonna take
time off and drive around for eight
weeks some so i've done that number
numerous times um but like visiting
national parks i haven't lived in it
on assignment yet but um but i might i
might consider that
that's awesome so let's go back a little
bit
um covet hits right you were on
assignment
in march i think he was actually here in
greensboro was that
is that true that's right yeah yeah it
was um what happened
like like walk us through what happened
and what was your
and how did you pivot and and deal with
the whole like change
yeah um so i i
i want to back up a little bit right
before that so
a year and a half before that i was
really into
wanting to learn more about telehealth
because i
felt like it was going to be a big thing
eventually and i liked
the idea of the flexibility of it and
having the freedom of it just knowing
about it
so i wanted to learn everything there
was to know about telehealth so i
invested in rob finding's telehealth
residency program
did that with him built a virtual clinic
online learned everything i could about
telehealth
fast forward a year and a half later
covid hits and i'm on assignment um
as a travel therapist at one of my
favorite facilities to work at
and um they had to close doors to
inpatient care as everybody did
um and so at that point i went to the
director and said let me help you
transition your inpatient care to a
telehealth system and program so
i was really fortunate to be able to
work with
um the company my colleagues
some of the upper management there to
help them design what they need
for telehealth and implement the
strategy that they needed in order to
help
transition into telehealth services so
that was really
um an honor to be a part of such a
huge transition for a giant hospital
system um
but ultimately like they didn't have
enough work for their permanent staff
you know i was let go
along with a lot of other of uh
traveling pts and permanent
pts uh in that area um
so as i do i thought like well we could
all just sit around and wait for the
jobs to pop back
or we could take matters into our own
hands and start creating jobs for
ourselves
like the patients are still out there
they still need our help we just have to
access them
um and with my experience in online
business
marketing webinars online course
creation
copywriting website design i
and then telehealth i
knew i had wanted to help other people
develop virtual clinics for themselves
back when i was um taking courses with
rob
but um and i actually had put it on the
back burner i was like well i'm not
going to do this just yet well covent
took it off the back burner for me
so between losing my job uh covid and
then i think aaron at that time i was
also at
your pt biz con 2020. um
it was like the culmination of all of
those things it was like all right
lighting the fire underneath your bum
let's do this
uh and so i launched my telehealth
mastermind
group and now have maybe 20 clients
in helping them to build their online
businesses and virtual practices
that's awesome that's awesome congrats
so thank you
you were doing so you were working as a
traveler and you had this kind of like
uh wanderlust pt's like side hustle
online webinar helping other pts get
placed and find it you know how to get
travel jobs and helping them kovid comes
and wipes out one piece of it
and you're just like within a few days
you're like i'm doing this other thing
yeah yeah that's awesome i mean
i mean how are you able to do that so
quickly online business is online
business
yeah it's it's like a tissue is a tissue
is a tissue
right if you know how to function in
a muscle on one side of the body you can
do the same on the other and online
business is the same thing like aaron i
remember you saying that you had to
search outside of physical therapy to
find what you needed in order to
learn about sales and marketing and and
it's the same thing you can apply these
principles
to anything in online business whether
it's
um whether you're a contractor or a
psychologist or a massage therapist or a
physical therapist or
um a coach a career coach
anything it's it's the same concepts
it's the same
uh finding a target market finding a
niche how do you speak with them
um funnels and email marketing and it's
all the same
yeah that's awesome so let's dive into
that for a second
what for you what are the um
[Music]
what are the ways that you're when
you're running your businesses like your
online businesses how are you finding
people what are the most effective like
online marketing
strategies or tools that you're using
yeah um
so i'm gonna say with what i'm not using
right now
i'm not huge on social media and
although i know i could be and it
probably is uh
something i'm missing out on right now
um
it's i don't wanna say stresses me out a
little bit but you know i don't wanna be
scrolling and being on social media
every day
so i actually never really relied on
social media for
where i find people just yet the key for
me
is the blog and email marketing
and my blog generates a lot of organic
searching and people coming to me
organically that way
which is great that's awesome so like
even like for traveling it's like
people are putting like travel pt jobs
and your stuff will show up
or a blog yeah i think if you search
like travel physical therapy
blog or something like that i might be
around there that's awesome
and are you i mean is that how you got
when you pivoted and you started this
um you know like mastermind for people
want to do like a virtual clinic
was it through blogs or search or how
did you find
those people so i already had a list of
about 3 000 people so i just emailed
that list and said hey guys
we don't have jobs now who wants to
start their own business you know are
you in the same spot that i'm in i'm
i'm ready to teach you everything i know
about telehealth and creating an online
business
and um that's it was just my existing
market basically that i reached out to
right so
they had so they had the same problem
you were having right
yeah yeah that's awesome so you send an
email
so a lot of people are listening like
you and i know email marketing but a lot
of people
yeah listening don't and i've tried to
explain it to people and i think people
are like what do you mean she just sent
an
email like maybe someone's having i'd
love to know if someone's having that
same question you just
you know or you know like shout us out
on instagram somewhere but yeah can you
share
just like what do you say in an email to
someone or
like we'll go back i'm going to go back
to how did you build your list in a
second but like what do you say in an
email to someone to get them to
figure out like do they want to buy this
course that you have
um aaron i want to say one thing too
yeah real quick about email because
people are like why email
um i think social media converts it like
one percent maybe two percent yeah
email marketing converts 20 27 times
better than that
um so you have to first establish
your uh
your rapport basically with your reader
you have to get them to know like and
trust you
and to understand who you are and what
you're about so it wasn't just you know
that they were sitting on my email list
they signed up once and they just sat
there and then i emailed them hey who
wants to do this it was
um i nurtured them through
hey this is who i am here's lots of free
information the give to get
mentality of like give them lots of free
information
um in order to get either
a buy or a click or a conversion of some
sort
so knowing that um what do i
what do i write in the email
is um being vulnerable
and uh gee i can't even remember what i
wrote but it was
it was something along the lines of like
hey so
uh covent who else is without a job and
who's interested in doing this
i'm thinking about doing this um here's
an application if you're interested
i think i had um maybe 50 or more
applicants
and actually i i messed up the first
time and then you helped me
so the first time around um i think i
said just drop in your email and phone
number here and we'll chat
well i had like 50 plus phone calls to
make with people
about my mastermind which was great
getting to talk to people
and then after that i imp i implemented
an application process
which helped weed it down a little bit
more and i don't have to call as many
people this time
this time around but that did that
answer the question
yeah i think so okay yeah because i
think so
so it's there's there's more to it than
just sending an email
and um it's really is it's just sending
an email to people who trust you
right you should say hey this is what
i'm struggling with are you struggling
with this too
let me know if you are i'd love to help
you out yeah
yeah yeah so let's go back how did you
get 3 000 people on your email list
did you buy that from somebody or like
what did you do to
you know build your email list yeah um
remember i told you in 2016 i started
wonderless pts and the first course that
i invested was
uh blogging it was a blogging course but
it was how to turn a blog into a
business
and the one thing that they taught in
addition to having a target market and
niching down
um the riches are in the niches another
fun marketing
term um but in addition to that she
taught about
lead magnets or bribe to subscribe and a
lead magnet is something that sits on
your website that gets that's an
irresistible offer that you're giving
people for free in exchange for their
email
um so on my website when you go there
you'll find things like the 10 must ask
interview questions
or a free webinar travel therapy 101 how
to become a traveling therapist
confidently even as a new grad or
the travel therapist checklist so
newgrad to
travel therapists these are the timeline
and the things to do
so these are called lead magnets and
these lead magnets
uh drop help people to drop in their
email and
in return for whatever it is that you're
giving them and that's that's the key to
developing an
email list that's awesome and then
so the value like so what's
so value's in the email list right and
so what happens then do you send them
like a message are you up all night
responding to email requests for your
freebie
how does that work yeah good question
then it drops into an automation
sequence
of uh basically hey thanks for
subscribing here's your download
um and then like a day later hey just
wanted to make sure you
you got that download thanks to you
aaron that was one of your
and i do get people replying to that but
this is happening automatically so that
it
it gets sent out automatically um and
then inviting them to
i think and then i asked them what i
learned was a golden question and the
golden question is
hey i want to make sure that the content
that i write
is specific to not just anyone but you
my newest reader
what is it what's your biggest question
about
topic travel therapy what's your biggest
question about telehealth
and then you get some people that reply
and ask that question and then you reply
and answer that question for them and
all of a sudden now you
are an authority and you're replying to
them
um so you're answering their question
and they're grateful for that so you're
developing that
that connection and that rapport with
the reader um
so that's maybe day two and then day
three invite them to a webinar
day four tell them a little bit about
your journey um and then just
keep sending them value valuable
information i think i email maybe once a
week
yeah that's awesome are you like
emailing about like
here's what i'm doing or here's travel
or answering questions
like what's valuable to people on your
email list
um i think a lot of the times it's
because when people come to your website
they're not reading all of your blog
posts all at once
so a lot of the time my emails are
related to
hey um has somebody told you not to
travel as a new grad
if so first have they traveled or they
might have missed
this blog post here you know if you want
to read
this click here so it clicks and then
this is another trick of the trade for
seo
which is search engine optimization and
helping to get yourself
found on the google is when people click
and get sent
back to your blog that helps to improve
the seo of your website or improve
visibility on the google so that's
another way that building an email list
is helpful for you growth of your online
business as well
but basically is pointing it's always
pointing back to my website
so people return to the website um in
order to help and then they'll read more
of the information there
yeah that's awesome that's so great and
that's one thing you just call
would you call that the you said your
split is your second email the golden
email you said are you saying the golden
question
golden coin and i learned that from yeah
i learned that from
that first course that i took and that
golden question is like hey i want to
make sure that
all of my content is specific just to
you so what is it that you're struggling
with
and then a lot of the times the question
is can i travel as a new grad
um so then i i reply and i say hey
thank you so much for reaching out it
really means a lot to me that you
my newest reader uh shared what your
biggest concern was
your concern is very common and as a
result
i wrote these blog posts about it check
them out
let me know what questions you have so i
have blog posts specifically to answer
like the biggest golden questions and
then i can just redirect people to those
blog posts
that's awesome that's awesome that's so
that's so great
um i i mean i just learned something so
i thought it could help well that's what
the i mean that's a podcaster for i love
it like i
ask a bunch of questions i'm trying to
like figure out what can i learn here
um what's something else that uh
you've learned um whether it's in travel
therapy running an online business or
even your webinars
um coaching people like that you think
would be valuable to us or
you know maybe that i might not know
because i don't know everything
um like what's your secret thing what's
that one little thing that you do and
you're like
people respond to this wow
i think regarding online business
i think the one thing that people don't
realize is lead magnets in email
marketing
um people will start with like trying to
build a brand or trying to build
instagram followers or
if you build your social media but you
have no
product or service to offer at the end
of the day
the people up top of your funnel
in your social media that are sitting in
social media don't
really matter because you have nowhere
to funnel them to
but understand social media is like your
end game so that you can help
funnel people to your website so that
you can
get them to opt in to your lead magnet
so that you can get them on your email
list and you can get them to know like
and trust you
and then purchase services from you but
chances are they're not coming to your
website
um erin they probably are coming to your
website and buying your cash bt
blueprint right away because i mean i
would do that um but chances are they're
not coming
to your website and then like buying
things right away they want to get to
know like and trust you just like
you know if you do go to any website um
it takes
like five or seven or ten times to get
out in front of somebody right to
actually make a conversion something
like that
yeah yeah and then and the point that
one of the points that you're making
that
i think people would be valuable to to
emphasize is that
it doesn't matter how many people follow
you on instagram or facebook or in your
groups
if they're not on your email list
they're not yours you
because you don't own the platform but
when they become when they get on your
email list
now you own the emails and you can
control the conversation
yeah right yeah absolutely yeah chances
are
people don't see you um you know if
you're posting things on
social media it depends but yeah i mean
i think it'd be fair to say that people
like you and me you don't have
tens of thousands of followers on
instagram are making
10 times more than people that have
hundreds of thousands of followers
because they got followers but they
don't have them on their email list they
don't have valuable
offers and uh nurture systems
i think that's that's where the magic's
at and it reminds me of um
kevin kelly's 1000 true fans
uh like you don't need to have
thousands of people you just need to
have 1 000
true fans that will buy and put out
anything that you
uh that will buy anything that you put
out and if you have one the concept
behind this is if you have
1 000 true fans and each of them
uh will buy you know 100 worth of
um your products or services each year
you already have made six figures if you
just have a thousand people that
love everything you do um and so that's
the concept between kevin kelly's 1000
true fans that i
i like that because then it doesn't keep
me reaching for
you know trying to get 10 million
followers it's just i just need the
people who
like love the wonderless pt's tribe
right and that's awesome and
that i love that what you said and it's
like okay
six figures a hundred thousand dollars
just like feels out of reach for a lot
of people even a million but if we
if we work backwards from it that's
right well we need a hundred people
a thousand people to pay us a hundred
bucks or 100 people to pay us a thousand
dollars
or 50 people to pay you two thousand
dollars right yeah right
yeah and so what could you do for
someone for two thousand dollars that
they would be like
this is the most amazing thing ever yeah
right absolutely
you could get them a a travel job that
doesn't suck and pays them an extra ten
thousand dollars more
per year like right bonus or show them
how to make a
business like those are all great right
um and people listening like what like i
want you to ask yourself what can you do
that's so valuable that someone would
want to pay you a hundred a thousand two
thousand
what jess is the thing
what's the thing that you um
help people with the most that like you
can't put a
a dollar number on the first thing that
comes to mind is mindset
is i help them to reframe their mindset
of like well i can't do this
whether it's a new grad who's trying to
travel or
somebody who isn't sure if they can
start their own online business
but the second thing that comes to mind
is i help
people to design a career
around the lifestyle that they want
instead of
designing a life around the career they
chose
so yeah yeah so design a
career around the lifestyle that you
want like what do you want
do you want to be able to have time to
take off
and travel the country and do you want
the freedom to be able to work from home
and when you want or
did you pick a career and now you're
going to build your life around
the job that you have to go to every day
yeah yeah so i think that's probably
what resonates with me the most hell
yeah that's what i want
that's i mean that's can i get this no
price tag there's no price tag on that
right
yeah that's awesome um jess is there a
question
that i should have asked you that you
think uh would be valuable
people listening
no i think we covered it all but if
anybody does have
more questions don't hesitate to reach
out this
i love i love to do this and it's funny
you said you asked me
jess why did you become a pt and i was
like ah no real passion there like there
wasn't
i'm sad i said that out loud but um
there's there was no like real
story behind it other than like it's a
good job i'll always have a job and i
can do it but
i have passion in helping other people
to achieve the freedom
in their lives that i've been able to
build for myself and that's
my passion is in business and my passion
is in helping other people
to achieve those things as well so it's
funny that i made myself
i worked myself this way anyway even
though i started as a pt
um and i want to say that it's the
investments
in the online courses and the
coaching and the mentorship that really
helped me leverage
my pt career outside of the clinical
skills
to build the business that i want and
the lifestyle that i want
so i encourage other people to invest in
themselves in the same way and do things
outside of
um clinical pt stuff if if that's where
your passion lies
oh that's really awesome that's so
awesome yeah
so if someone wants to reach out to you
what's the best way for them to
find you is it like through your website
social media or something yeah
i am on instagram wonderlustpts.com
w-a-n-d-e-r-l-u-s-t-p-t-s
uh but also the website
wanderlustpts.com
that's awesome and then if they go there
they got they can get the freebies for
like the um like travel stuff
is there anything yeah i mean yep so
there's a free webinar available there's
the 10 must ask interview questions and
there's also the travel
uh travel therapist checklist and if you
also want to be connected with my
recommended
