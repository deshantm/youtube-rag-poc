if someone wants to sell Physical
Therapy what are three things they need
to know hire a coach like this man right
here because I didn't know how anything
about how to sell physical therapy and
thankfully I found Aaron labauer I think
it was like a week into business I
started working with him my third week
into business he taught me how to sell
packages to give me the first quick wins
I made 7 400 in my first month in
business even though it was scary and it
was hard he helped me shift my mindset
and then follow his three principles be
quick to act be quick to ask for help
and be quick to share your wins and
lessons
