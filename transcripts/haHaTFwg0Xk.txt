sometimes you win and sometimes you
learn so we don't lose and we don't fail
it's not a win unless they make fifty
thousand dollars with one email but it's
actually taking that first step which
seems insignificant is often the most
impactful i've got something i wanna i
wanna share with you guys i wanna teach
you something real quick this strategy
is one where it was aaron i need new
patients fast i need money now i i
really like you know i want a little
money i need some money just to make
sure that we get uh you know get some
traction feel like this investment's
worth it etc um sometimes like what do i
do like
if you have systems set up like you can
get money fast with one email but the
first time you really need to like look
at how the whole thing is done so
what's the goal
new patience but it's really your
patience fast please how do we do that
we got to get leads so in order to get
leads we have to identify who this is
your avatar we gotta know who they are
we gotta hit them up on the internet and
socials and we have to have an
irresistible offer
once we get leads we have to nurture
them so you want to lead you want to
confirm that you've heard them you want
to confirm their pain right you know
with your patients like if i touch you
where you hurt my patient knows i know
where the problem is right our patients
they need a thank you
thank you email
it's really like there's a there's an
email that we need to send
but there's also like a page
that goes in there there's a thank you
page and there's an email
we need to share our story
you got to share your story this isn't
this isn't this sometimes email one but
it's really more like email two through
three through five
share your story
and we have to create calls to action
cta
everything you produce online needs to
have a call to action
it's not a uh it's not a buy my stuff
call to action it's a look out for the
next email call to action it's follow me
on instagram
reply back now and let me know your
thoughts on this
comment below uh tag someone who needs
to hear this
there's always a call to action people
need to be told what to do okay once we
nurture them now we have to enroll them
but we want to get them through some
kind of application it's a process
people go through is that now they're
actively asking to work with you or
they're actively giving you information
before
we even ask for the sale
which helps
smooth out the process because really
it's remember i said sales is all about
asking the right questions
so the application is
about asking the right questions then we
want to get them into some kind of for a
clinic we call it total body diagnostic
for a coaching business i call it a
strategy call you can call it a clarity
call you don't call it a sales call but
it's a sales call for total body
diagnostic
we're going to look at you head to toe
find out where it hurts
and
help you figure out the exact root cause
of the problems so we can fix it with a
strategy call i'm gonna help you get
clear
on where you are
and where you wanna go and the road uh
the obstacles or roadblocks keeping you
from getting there on your own and
after that we'll build a plan together
and if you'd like to work on the plan
together with us we'll make it we'll
tell you how we can help you do that and
then we want to give i call it the piff
poc
so for your clinic is it it's a
paid in full plan of care i want people
to buy into the plan of care or i want
them to
buy into the 12-week or 12-month or
three-year program that you're enrolling
them into and you need to be able to do
all nine of these if you could rate
yourself in these where are you you
probably know who it is
maybe your orange on this on this maybe
you're green but think about it like do
you have an application
are you good at this part you might be
better at getting people to buy packages
of ten or eight already you maybe share
your story
i guarantee there's probably a lot of
you that don't have a thank you page or
thank you email and then some of you
you're probably like yeah i can do the
call to action some of you might be
afraid of doing it how do you rate
yourself on here like where are your
colors is there anything that you know
you need to need to do
already if you don't know who you're
never going to target them on social
media and they will never respond to
your irresistible offer
if they don't get a thank you email they
won't they won't get the thing you're
offering them and they won't know to go
if they don't get on the page they won't
know to go look in the email and if you
don't share your story they won't
connect with you so they won't respond
to your call to action
if it goes in the circle it really goes
down to application funnel
they will never apply
and they won't show up for your strategy
call or tbd and they won't enroll
