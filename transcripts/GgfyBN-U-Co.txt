there's three things you need to crush
your goals in 2021.
so what are your goals maybe you have a
monetary goal maybe it's you know
5k a month not bad but what if we made
it 8k
right that's just under 100 000 what do
we need to do
we need to make it uh 9k 8.4
per month and now you're at six figures
you only want to see five patients a day
and you want to spend uh what five weeks
out of town with your family or you know
home at 3 30 each day something like
that what are your three big goals
how many patients do you want to help i
want to help not just it's not just me
helping five patients a day but i want
to help 100
100 million or i want to help 10 000
people in greensboro
okay there's three things that you need
to be able to do this number one you
have to commit
so once you commit to doing it then it's
your job to take action
and then you need community or
accountability so you need community
so there's a couple pieces in here so
when we commit
well what's the thing it's like it won't
work like so most people think
it won't work or not perfect so they
won't commit
the number one reason most people won't
jump in a community
is because i can
do it myself have you ever thought well
i could just do this myself why would i
pay someone to show me i do it i could
do it myself
well if you commit to the process you'll
figure out how to make it work
you will find the formula you will
actually when you commit you can set
your goals
if you don't set goals how are you going
to achieve them and then if you commit
that's where what else you need to
commit you have
a clear definition of success now when
you take action
you might be thinking i'm not ready when
you take action that's when we eliminate
failure
when you take action that's when
you start the you know the biz
you know you start or you make that
first higher or you
open your second location so it's not
the same as
um build it and they will come but when
you take action
you ask the right questions when you
take action
that's when you help people and there's
a lot of ways to
help others when you take action
that's where you get results when you
do in the community there's three
communities that you need
you need to be around other people who
are crushing it and doing better than
you
so you need to be like with the small
fish in the scene so you want to be
around others
oh i like when i go uh places this is
where like i'm
my mastermind now i want to be
with people who are doing better than me
you know i don't want to be the the
smartest person in the room
so um you want to learn from others i'm
going to go to events because it's going
to help me do that
and i'm going to do and i work with a
coach slash
mentor so these are the three things
here
community mastermind so it's like my
mastermind group
that i'm in the events so
it's not just like the facebook group
i'm in it's like
physically going to an event so when you
commit what's the number one reason most
people don't commit
is because they think it won't work but
if you have the formula
for success or for growth for your
business
or for making bread then all you have to
do is follow the recipe
so for instance um people who commit
to launching a cash practice get into my
course the cash pd blueprint and is
basically a recipe for a six figure cash
practice
but you would never get in that course
if you weren't committed to
treating your patients the way you felt
was right
freeing yourself from relying on
physicians referrals and insurance for
payments and uh you would never commit
to doing that
if you didn't see it was possible for
you if other people like you or the
thousands of students i've put through
the course
you hadn't seen their testimonials and
reviews so you wouldn't commit to doing
it because
you it wouldn't work but you might be
stubborn like me
uh 12 years ago ago like i know this is
gonna work i'm gonna make it work i'm
gonna figure it out
and even then even though i wasn't
talking about cash practice and teaching
myself
i went to find other people who were
doing different parts of it and could
teach me different things
and to make it work so what's the number
one reason most people don't take action
because they're not ready they're afraid
to fail it's not perfect
but what happens if you never take
action if you never take action
you will never help other people and we
got into physical therapy not to make
money
because if we were all serious about
making money we'd go into banking
or finance you got in this to help other
people but if you
never take action and you never learn
how to sell physical therapy you'll
never learn how to
help more people get physical therapy
than are currently getting it
right in order to get more people to get
physical therapy they're currently
getting we have to learn how to
sell physical therapy how could you
actually help more people
if you just always waited until the time
was right
so when an opportunity is presented
to either get the formula follow the
recipe or
maybe work with someone who can help you
get results faster and help more people
faster
you have to be ready to take action
we're going to talk about this one
events like what is the what is the
event okay
there's coaching and mastermind groups
and
working with mentors and events and all
of these are about putting yourself
around the right people because why do
you need community
because if you're an entrepreneur and
your
partner spouse family members or not
the people around you if they're not
entrepreneurs they're going to give you
a lot of negative feedback about why you
shouldn't take a risk
so you have to be at events and
community
to um be around like-minded people who
can support you
and pull you along and so you can put
yourself in a room with people that are
that are smarter than you who know
business who are more experienced at you
you want to be in the room
you want to be surrounded by people that
are earning more than you they're
helping more people than you they're
seeing more people than you
even if i want to learn manipulations i
need to be in a room around people
who've been doing them longer than me or
you know i'd so i'd rather go learn from
my friend chris the chiropractor
manipulations because he's been doing he
does it multiple times a day all day
long
you know when you go to events what your
job is
is to find a community you maybe you
find a mentor there
or a mastermind but really your your
goal is to find that one
strategy this can make the whole thing
pay off
immediately which is like what's the
financial win like how do i go to an
event and
find that one idea i can implement the
same day or within 24 hours
or even like 30 days it's going to get
me one more new client
customer or patient that's one of the
two things i'm looking for the other
thing i'm looking for is
who is here that i can learn from and uh
three it's like is this the community
that i want to be a part of
so that's um why events are important
a lot of times in events you'll find a
coach or mentor
you'll find other people that can
leverage your time
or they can show you how to leverage
your time give you the formulas
and give you that clear path of success
but really
as you can see in here there's not like
a facebook marketing strategy in here
there's not it's not like one facebook
marketing strategy or one sales strategy
or one online business strategy
this is all about making the commitment
to go all in
taking action and putting yourself
around the right people with the right
mentors and with the right community to
support you
