now you get to sell people at this point
and it doesn't feel sleazy
or douchey or unscrupulous at all
if you want people to apply to work with
you instead of feeling pushy
and like a big time marketer or a sleazy
salesman
or some people call it like a douchey
salesman you don't want to seem
like sleazy and salesy you need an
application funnel
a contact form on your website just says
contact me
how many times a week does someone just
randomly contact me
or contact you or ask you questions
instead of a contact form or even a book
now button
like number one mistake i see people
make is using the book now button or
schedule now
it's great you've got a great call to
action it's probably what you chose
through your facebook page or
what someone put there for you but the
only people they're gonna
call now or book now are people that are
hot leads they already know they want to
work with you they're not people with
questions
who if given the opportunity to talk
with you would then work with you
so if you're using those options you're
not
capturing a large portion of people that
are looking for you and wanting to do
business with you they just have some
questions and
need to talk first so if you hate sales
you're like i don't want to be salesy or
pushy
i don't want to go to door to door and
try to drum up cold business and instead
you want
patients clients customers to contact
you directly
even ask and apply to do business with
you
then you need an application funnel so
an application funnel is kind of like a
contact form on steroids it's kind of
like applying for a job
but instead of applying for a job you're
applying for physical therapy
or for work you're not but you're not
really filling out that kind of
application either
what an application form is and funnel
is it's a series of pages people go to
including a testimonials page including
a
forum where they give you their name
phone number email
but also information about what's wrong
what they've tried to do about it what
they want
out of physical therapy instead or in
some of their goals
and some information about like when
they would prefer an appointment
and then they fill out that form and
they're sent to a
thank you page that gives them some more
instructions and a little video
and an email and then says hey thank you
so much for filling out our
form we'll be reaching out to you within
the next 24 to 48 hours or the next
you know business day to chat with you
about what's going on and how we might
help
in the meantime click on this link to
check out our
website or check out this video on
youtube etc
so an application funnel isn't just a
form
it's a series of pages that send
prospects
through an indoctrination sequence which
indoctrination sequences is a sequence
of messages where they get to know
like and trust you before you even talk
to them and
before they even choose to apply they're
going to have seen some of these
messages
so this isn't a hot audience and this
isn't really a cold audience this is
someone who's in the middle warm
looking for help most people are just
going after hot what you're missing and
you think you need to go after cold but
what you're missing is the big section
of warm people
and these warm people these people that
are on your website or on your facebook
page want
more information about you and this is
how you're gonna
get them to give you information about
them so you can have a conversation with
them
you can use this kind of funnel for
anything
you can use it for physical therapy you
can use it for business coaching health
coaching
my cousin i helped him set it up for
financial
advising done it with life coaching
you can do it for pretty much any
product or service you could do it to
sell cars you wouldn't want to do it to
sell
25 cent widgets um and
one reason this works for like more of a
higher ticket item
you know hundreds of dollars or
thousands of dollars is because
it sends people through to the end who
are more highly qualified
and it gives people who aren't self
qualified an opportunity to learn more
about
what's going on with themselves and get
more information from you what an
application funnel does
is it creates even more desire for your
product or service and at the same time
positions you
as the expert and authority that your
customers and clients want to do
business with
and it pre-qualifies them which means it
it moves them in or out really what it
does doesn't really move them out but it
moves them in
faster so that you know you're getting
on the phone or meeting with someone
in person who is ready to buy your
product or service
or actually really wants your product or
service versus someone who wants to just
come and kick the tires
and this way you don't actually have to
sell anything you get to
use these automated systems um to
uh pre-sell the products for you so you
don't have to sell then if you actually
get to the point where you learn
sales and you understand it's not sleazy
then now you get to sell
people at this point and it doesn't feel
sleazy or douchey
or unscrupulous at all because they've
already asked you
to do business with you you're just
asking questions to confirm what they
want
the idea is is that you want people to
ask to work with you and how do you do
that you don't do that through a book
now button
or a contact me form you do that through
the application funnel
