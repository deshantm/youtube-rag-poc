hey welcome back to the cash B2 Lynch
Hour podcast I'm your host Aaron LeBauer
and today we're going to talk about what
makes you uncomfortable
so what makes you uncomfortable as a
physical therapist what makes you
uncomfortable as a business owner and
how
to grow
and how to uh get past that so you can
make a lot of money you can help
shitload of people and you can live a
life of freedom and fulfillment
without anyone micromanaging you
breathing down your neck and telling you
what to do
especially a boss insurance companies
um
or someone else I don't know so
here's the theme like I talk to a lot of
people I have a lot of people you know
who are crushing it and then I encounter
a lot of people who are who want to
crush it
but make excuses
okay the there's two things that I need
you to understand before we even get
into all the things
is that growth doesn't happen in your
comfort zone so you may not know this
but I'm like I used to teach yoga holy
cow Aaron's done a lot of things well
I'm 49 years old I've done a lot of
things I haven't just done the same
thing forever and I never will do the
same thing forever from here on out
um I did a
Baptiste inspired yoga teacher training
probably 2015 right is the coaching
business was starting to grow maybe it
was 2013. it was almost 10 it was 10
years ago
as a coaching business started to grow I
had to stop teaching yoga because the
clinic was cool I mean I had a dope
schedule where I would work I would see
patients from eight to one on Mondays
and Fridays
from two to six on Tuesday Thursdays and
eight to twelve and two to six on
Wednesdays and so
Tuesday and Thursday mornings I would go
to yoga I would actually teach yoga at
noon on Tuesdays and I would teach her
assist on Saturday mornings and I would
go to the other class on Saturday
mornings it was great but then the
coaching business got busy enough and I
had to I had to choose one and I didn't
make money doing yoga but anyways one of
the things I learned in yoga is you is
growth didn't happen in your comfort
zone
and as soon as so in yoga terms that
feels like if you're ever doing a post
and you're holding it for five breaths
yoga doesn't start until the pose gets
hard yoga really doesn't start you're
not doing yoga until you're ready to get
out of the pose
right it's almost like you're not really
lifting weight until you're ready to
stop and it gets hard and you want to
put it down okay now that's starting to
be when your strength and growth is
happening when you want to start putting
it down but you know you got you need
three more reps
okay so one
this is about what makes you
uncomfortable two growth doesn't happen
in your comfort zone so you have to
recognize what makes you uncomfortable
so you can learn from it and grow from
it and three you're sabotaging your own
success
almost 100 of the time
when you're working with me or you're
working with someone else or you're
doing something other people have done
and you want to be like hey I want to
have a business like Aaron whether it's
a clinic like Aaron or an online
coaching business like Aaron and you're
not making the progress you want
somewhere in your life you're sabotaging
your own success
okay so the things that make you
uncomfortable I've got a list this is
cool I got a list but I also have some
steps to grow to the next level and
there's some lessons in here so look
before we get into this if you're
watching on YouTube please hit the like
subscribe and notify click the
notification Bell
and also comment like YouTube loves the
comments
um you know even like if you're
listening the podcast on iTunes leaving
a review like doing those things if
you're watching this in the CashPoint
Edition comment below because it helps
the algorithms and there's two things
that this this does one it allows you to
synthesize the information that you
learn
two you're sharing it with others you're
sharing what you've synthesized with
others so you can help the next person
in three it helps the algorithm help
more people see this stuff because
there's 200 000 physical therapists
in the US and believe it or not I think
there's probably 100 000 of them don't
even know who I am and don't know that
cash-based physical therapy is an
opportunity for them
so what makes you uncomfortable number
one
talking about money I need to do a whole
podcast on talking about money but just
talking about money makes you
uncomfortable
money is good money does great things
money solves problems money doesn't make
you happy and people with money are not
evil having those beliefs means that you
won't have money
money comes and goes
time is fleeting you might lose money
today but go get money tomorrow I can
lose a hundred thousand dollars a day
and I can go get it tomorrow like I know
what to do to go get it because I've
been around people who have more of it
and I've seen their attitudes and the
way they talk about money I've spent
hundreds of thousand dollars on business
coaching and courses and I've gotten it
back in droves
because you know what I'm doing is I'm
investing myself
and
what we need to do is talk about money
more especially as a physical therapist
it's like awkward to talk about with
your patients talk about with your
family
talking about money makes you
uncomfortable
money is just a way to exchange value
it's a way to quantify
how many people you've helped
I know that my coaching business did
over a million dollars last year that
I've helped a shitload of people get
like I know like I don't know how many
people have helped because not everyone
says hey Aaron thank you very much I get
more of the hey Aaron stop talking about
the APTA like that and blah blah but I
know that if I'm making money
then I'm helping thousands of people
because I could not help you know that
you know I could not make that much
money if I wasn't actually helping
someone because I'm not stealing money
from people I'm not taking it from
people unwillingly I'm exchanging value
so I'm getting some money and I'm
exchanging 10x the value you know so
like uh let's say Owen Johnson speaking
of pt bizcon
he gave me eighteen thousand dollars
coaching this first year in business
and he made 225 thousand dollars
wouldn't you say that's a fair Exchange
he gave me 18 000 and I helped him make
225 000. that's pretty dope I've had
other people
pay me 18 000 or twenty one thousand
dollars
twenty five thousand dollars
and I've helped them make
another twenty five thousand dollars but
you know what else they got
they got the twenty five thousand
dollars well I'm sure I haven't helped
them I'm sure they've made more a
hundred thousand dollars for the year
but the other thing that they get is not
just money it's time
it's um
it's time it's satisfact career
satisfaction feeling like a whole I mean
Owen will tell you all these things came
to him he has a better relationship with
his with his fiance now his wife
um or maybe it was maybe they were
married I think they got married since
we started coaching together you know
his better personal relationship better
relationship with his patients his
career
um gosh Matthew audio someone that Owen
and Jen referred
just applied for a transformation
contest it was like I was about to get
out of PT and now since joining The
Mastermind two months ago you know I
love my profession again
like does that matter right but what we
do is we talk about money we talk about
how to make money how to save money how
to use money and leverage money talking
about money makes you uncomfortable then
you need to talk about it more and maybe
it's the people you're around you need
to put yourself around people that are
comfortable talking about money because
I'll tell you about all my money and
where I where I put it and what I do
with it and how much I make
if it makes you uncomfortable
like then that's something you need to
get over okay
number two what makes you uncomfortable
sales
makes you uncomfortable a thought of
sales if like I don't use the word sales
in my marketing very often because
everyone thinks marketing is the problem
but really the problem is sales the
problem is
sales sales one you've experienced
really shitty sales you've you've
experienced pushy people trying to tell
you what to do
but real sales ethical sales is asking
questions and offering a solution to a
problem that people have
in exchange for money but that problem
is going to be worth you know five
thousand dollars and I'm gonna ask you
for a thousand or maybe there's no
monetary value we can put on being able
to have sex comfortably with your
partner again
um but I can say Hey you know I can help
you do that in eight weeks physical
therapy for that is going to cost 2500
bucks
okay it's sales so you have to get over
the sales thing because I believe
strongly
that physical therapy is the right
solution for pretty much anyone who's in
pain or injured now or in the past and
people who don't want to fall over and
Fracture their hip femur pelvis when
they're 75. they need physical therapy
so I feel it's my ethical obligation to
be a master at sale so I can use it for
good not just for making money but if
you're in it just to make money so we
talked about money but if you're in this
and your only goal is making money and
you're desperate the sales is going to
come across that way and that's probably
what you've experienced from other
people okay number three
email marketing email marketing makes
you uncomfortable
I can't tell you I mean I've seen a Cent
I don't know 25 emails in the last three
weeks to promote pdbizcon and I'm going
to send another 30 or 40 emails between
now and March okay email marketing it
makes you uncomfortable because you
don't understand it
right and if you understood it you'd be
like ah there's Aaron again send me a
message yes okay I'm finally gonna buy a
ticket to PT bizcon right because if you
buy a ticket to PT bizcon you won't keep
getting emails about PT bizcon you'll
get them here there
but maybe you're subscribed with two or
three or even five email addresses to my
list and you buy a ticket to PT bizcon
or you enroll in the cash PD blueprint
you're still going to get messages to
your other emails
about that program if you've signed up
because you've asked me for help
so here's a couple things one you just
have to recognize it I'm going to keep
emailing you until you say yes and then
if you have another email address like
there's no way my system knows that that
is the same person so you just have to
kind of ignore it or just be like all
right cool let me figure out which email
I like the best and you know
you can unsubscribe the others and
here's the thing with email marketing
you can unsubscribe at any time The
Links at the bottom of the email if I
email you something you don't like it
before you click unsubscribe check
yourself and see why did that make you
uncomfortable
is It Something I Said is it the way I
said it or is it the way that you
interpreted it right
oh God I got some crazy emails last week
and I'm just trying to help people who
are on my list grow their business and
like I don't like the tone of this and
seriously when I looked at the emails I
was like really like you don't like the
tone of this it was did a seagull steal
your phone
hey maybe you know I was like I know
most people
um you know look at their phones when
they're in the bathroom you know maybe
you dropped yours in the toilet and when
you're trying to sign up for PT bizcon
that's why you didn't get a ticket so
click the link here and get back in and
you know join us a PD bizcon I mean I
had like three or four people reply to
that it was like stop
I'm just like this is fun it's funny I
don't know that one email makes me a lot
of money in my blueprint book sequence
so I let's just say you go to my my
website cashpd blueprint book and you
put in your name phone number
address email
go to the next page you're like oh no I
don't want to pay nine dollars for Aaron
to ship me this book for free
let me think about this longer
let me go look on Amazon oh Darren on
Amazon is 20 bucks okay so if you didn't
buy it but you fill out the name phone
number email part
you're on my list and I can send you
um a series of emails I send a series of
four maybe five emails for when you
abandon the cart
everyone does this Etsy does this I mean
Amazon I mean a lot of places do this
where they follow you around with ads I
follow you around with emails and one of
my most successful emails from that one
I used it for the
um for p PT bizcon and I only said to
people who had clicked on the sales page
or clicked on a link in one of the
emails about PT bizcon and I had like
three or four people get upset about it
because it was funny
anyways you don't understand email
marketing and so you don't know how you
can use it to make
hundreds of thousands of dollars in your
business I've got one email sequence
it's easily made me
five hundred thousand dollars
easily probably a million probably if I
trace that email sequence to all the
webinars it sent people to I've probably
made a million dollars with the email
sequence if you're my Mastermind I'll
give you a you know and you sell online
courses or programs I'll give that
sequence to you I just did that with Joe
Gambino we just gave it to him set it up
for him and his
um business and he's going to be using
it as a attractive character email
sequence it's awesome it's so powerful
okay the other thing that makes you
uncomfortable is doing the actual work
and being responsible for your own
success I just did a whole podcast
episode on this
but you've got to do the work
okay if you don't have kids you've got
plenty of time look me Chinese Greco
um there's five other gens you have all
kids you know other guys that have kids
um Joe Gambino just had a new baby who
else has kids
we're doing the work like there's you
know my uncle said this to me he's like
Aaron I don't care what he was what the
topic was I was like you know I don't
have time for that he's like you have
time you just aren't making it a
priority
so you need to do the work doing the
work makes you uncomfortable you think
just joining the program or buying a
course or finally spending money on
yourself means that the results are
going to happen you actually have to do
the work like I can show you how to fish
but I can't fish for you
and then my coach Pedro's posted
something today on his uh his story was
like I'm gonna show you how to fish but
don't come take my fishing spot
you know it's like that's what I'm going
to crush you it's like I'm happy to show
you how to fish because there are plenty
of fish this Pond keeps getting
restocked Pond is being restocked every
day with money and with patience and
I'll show you how to fish but you got to
go out there and do the work you have to
be responsible for your own success it's
not the course it's not the program it's
not the advice you know I'm not here to
be your friend I'm here to help you grow
a business and help millions of patients
and it's your responsibility to be
responsible for your own success and
admit when you know what this isn't just
isn't for you or admit when you haven't
done the work so do the work it's hard
but it and it can be rewarding and if
you're doing the right work for the
right reason with the right Mission and
you know the right you have the USP and
your avatar down it doesn't feel like
work at all like it really doesn't feel
like work at all so
anyways do the work number five
commitment
committing to yourself like commitment
makes you uncomfortable so people are
scared to commit and they back out or
they're scared to make a commitment and
they stay on the fence
or they think you've made a commitment
and I can get out of it I'm like
um you made a commitment like Oliver
Platinum Mastermind members after 30
days agree and they sign a platinum
promise which has you know there's 20
things that I'm responsible for and four
or five things that you're responsible
for and one of them is keeping the
commitment you made after three days to
you know working together for 12 months
to radically change your life your
business and the way you impact your
patients and it's a commitment to
yourself your business and your family
a lot of people think they can get out
of it and you can but you know what
disappoints me is that you know I
clearly helped you know I'm going to bat
for you and you're making a commitment
to yourself but clearly that wasn't a
commitment you really made it was like
you're putting your toe in the water you
know there's a lot of other things where
people make shallow commitments because
you're not all in
because you don't have a big reason big
enough reason why
but the one of the reasons I don't
understand it and I've told some of my
my other friends and people in my
coaching groups like I just don't
understand is because when I make a
commitment I'm all in
I'm not going to sit on the fence
forever we've talked about how speed is
your friend in business
but I'm going to think about it and say
yes or no I'm not going to go half
halfway into something
right I'm not gonna go halfway into a
business or an idea I've had plenty of
people you know Jake who does my ads and
sales for me and Greg Todd and it feels
like Aaron you need to try this would be
great I'm like yeah great let me think
about it I think but if I go all in on
it is going to take time away from the
other things I'm focused on
and it's called having laser focus but
it's also being committed to the thing
that you say yes to and when you say no
you've committed to no that's not that
doesn't work with my game plan and I'm
not going to do it I'm committed to this
other thing and you have to stay
committed committed to your patience
committed to your learning but really
committed to yourself your business and
things that you want
which isn't to say that once you commit
you can't change course
but it's once you commit to something
see it through until you realize
you know this isn't the right path and
then you adjust but you haven't changed
your commitment you've changed your
strategy does it make sense it's called
you know be committed because the first
time you do something it's not always
going to work and the people that are
committed to the to the goal to the
process are the ones that are going to
win and see it through what is it Thomas
Edison what invented
what is it Thomas Edison that invented
20 250 light bulbs before he got one to
work something like that that's Thomas
Edison yeah I always get Edison and
Jefferson confused because they're old
guys I think with the same kind of first
name
but anyways you get the point I don't
know the stats on that but that's called
commitment what makes you uncomfortable
Tech
God damn trouble
text should not make you uncomfortable
it's 2023 if tech makes you
uncomfortable just stop trying to
pretend if you're a PT listening to this
or OT speech pathologist you learned
spinothalamic tracks if you can learn
that you can learn the tech the tech is
even easier it's just because you don't
understand it it's an easy excuse to
keep you from failure it's like oh the
text too hard I'm not going to do it if
I fail it's not my personal
responsibility for the failure it's the
tax fault
stop blaming the tech
take responsibility for your own success
just stop it get over it and look you
can always hire someone else to do it
for you but the best owner operators are
the people that understand the process
and understand the outcome so you can
hire the right people
so you really got to understand the tech
because if you can run one of these you
can run the PT email engine you can run
click funnels you can do zapier
you can do all those things do you do
Facebook and Instagram
okay number seven the APTA what makes
you uncomfortable the APTA well for good
reason the apeta
I don't know what else we need to say
the apj makes you uncomfortable it's
good
great APTA
um does it make me uncomfortable
I don't think it makes you uncomfortable
it's just they're not serving me
as a physical therapist and business
owner not even the PPS that's why I
created PT bizcon that's why I created
courses and do my own webinars because
I've decided a long time ago
that if I want to change the profession
I can't do it from inside the APTA
because
they won't let me as much as you're
gonna when I email about it or post
about it if you message me and say Aaron
will you just need to be on more
committees and try harder look I've had
about eight different uh
presentations for PPS or CSM turndown
I've had a couple articles for the PPS
impact magazine turned down I have
spoken at CSM before once on my own I
spoke at PPS as a student with Bob
Duvall I didn't write that proposal I do
have a did do a couple webinars back in
the day but you know they would get 25
people in the webinar and I would get
500 you know and they put my thing up on
the website and I can't even access it
unless I'm a member you know it's like
and they're charging money for it and I
don't know whatever it's totally cool
but the APTA makes you uncomfortable
because every time I talk about it you
react to it you get defensive of the
APTA you just gotta understand that they
don't serve everybody
I was a big supporter for a long time
and when covet came around and the
Dental Association the spa Association
were the best resources for me as a
private practice owner to deal with
covid
and and I asked the PPS president I said
hey can you make these resources
available for free to all business
owners are like no that's a benefit of
being a member I was like you've got
this all wrong like that should be free
serve other people and then they'll see
why it there's benefits to membership
and they didn't do that and they were
basically like no that's not that's not
how we do things and I was like great
I'm not renewing I mean after 12 years
so anyways APK makes you uncomfortable
every time I talk about it you react
um that's totally cool
um but it's not for everybody what makes
you uncomfortable it's a belief in
yourself
um I'm not a therapist
I'm not you know my brother is he might
be able to better speak about this but
and we lack belief in ourselves we're
unable to invest in ourselves and most
people who I see fail don't believe that
they can do it so what's the one thing
that I know can solve this problem
look I probably believe in you more than
you believe in yourself but the one
thing that can solve this and you know
what is to get around to other people
they're doing what you want to do
so you can be like oh man I'm just like
them if they can do it so can I
I mean
that's what being around some of my
peers does for me
you know Ryan obenesser I mean Greg Todd
Paul Goff Jared Carter you know being
around those guys I'm like oh they're
just like me
you know I gotta go be around Pedro's
cooling bedros he's an eight he's
speaking of PD bizcon
he's making well over eight figures
dude doesn't have a college degree
you know he's the same age as me he
likes to he's more of a meathead than I
am I'm more of an endurance athlete
but we have you know similar way of
thinking you know similar processing
it's awesome I'm like great
he can do it I can do it he believes in
me I'm like okay you believe I can do a
three to five million dollar business
okay how do I do that because I don't
know how
but now that he tells me and I go put
myself around like last week at
operation black site around all these
other entrepreneurs who are making more
than I am like they're just you know
like I can I I know I can do it if they
can do it I'm like how can how can how
do I not have what they have
so I build belief in myself
okay you know it makes you uncomfortable
number nine sharing your dreams the
reason sharing your dreams makes you
uncomfortable is because everyone else
is shooting them down don't be around
those don't share them with the people
that put them down you need to be around
people that are gonna be like damn
that's dope like
I want you to win and I do I want you to
win I want to know what your dreams are
what are your goals what do you really
want you're never going to make them
happen if you keep them to yourself
because you feel embarrassed that your
dreams aren't good enough for other
people like stop trying to please other
people and just do it for you or your
family don't care about what other
people think of you that's what's
keeping you from success number 10
sharing your lessons Okay the only
reason I'm here is because I've shared
what I learned I'm sure shared the
journey and I've shared and I've shared
what works and what didn't work sharing
your lessons and then 11 asking for help
what makes you uncomfortable is asking
for help because you're smart why you
know I'm supposed to be the smartest
person in the room with my patients but
not as a business owner ask for help
so those three things all come from ego
sharing your dreams belief in yourself
sharing your dreams sharing your lessons
and asking for help you feel like if I
do that people what are people going to
think of me you have to stop that and
you have to stop worrying about what
other people think for you think of you
if you want to grow your business the
fastest way possible you have to ask for
help you have to share your wins and
lessons and share your dreams number 12
was it do it makes you feel like an
imposter so what makes you uncomfortable
is feeling like an imposter like who am
I to be able to tell patients this so
new grads who think they need five years
of experience to help patients that's
other lame pts have put that on you
feeling imposter like some days I'm like
who am I to you know put on PT bizcon
it's such a massive event it's going to
cost a lot of money you know I'm like
who am I to do that I've gotten over
that a lot
um over the last five or six years like
that thought doesn't come in my mind at
all but the only reason I can share it
is because it's come through my mind I'm
like this is such a massive thing like
who am I to do this well who am I not to
do it like no one else has stepped up to
do it like I said like APTA has said no
to me like eight times for sharing how
to Market directly to patients and
building a cash-based practice or
creating online products and leveraging
uh your expertise as a online course or
how do we reach millions of people as
physical therapists like they don't want
me to share that at the events I don't
know who's on the deciding committee
but great so I'm gonna do my own thing
so stop feeling like an imposter but it
does it makes you uncomfortable you just
have to recognize it recognize it's
there and be like all right um what
makes you uncomfortable when you when
you're feeling sold too this goes back
to number two sales when you're feeling
like you're being sold to
you're like oh I know the drill Aaron
I'm like you do you know the drill okay
great like do you feel like you're being
sold to it makes you uncomfortable just
realize that if you've if you feel like
you're being sold to and it makes you
uncomfortable you've had bad sales
experiences I just need to get to know
you before I can let you know if I can
help you or not
so it goes back to the sales and money
thing just get over that part work with
people you who have success that you
want who've done what you want to do and
can get you there even faster even if
you know you can get there on your own
it's your obligation to get there faster
so you can help even more people 50 14
what makes you uncomfortable paying for
help a lot of these things
you know if they came out of my head
they they rolled together paying for
help whether it's help someone else grow
your business for coaching for like
answering questions like paying for help
like yeah you can find a lot of great
ideas you know on the internet you can
survey all your friends who've done it
once
you can probably figure this out on your
own because you're smart because you
know I did but took Derek eight months
to make 15K in a month and it took me 15
months it took
um oh and a year to make 225 000 in his
clinic and took me like five years five
and a half years to do that right so
it's speed you know as I get it become a
better Coach and have better systems in
the business success
um amplifies so it's all about speed so
if it makes you uncomfortable to pay for
help or ask for help look you can ask
for help but if you're not paying for it
what are you going to do with that
information I know this like
if I want something
if I want to get a massage if I want to
get a service you know I want to pay for
it because then I can get it whenever I
want because I'm exchanging money for
time of that person or the service or
the information rather than doing it out
of their goodness of their own heart
because one I may not show up and take
it seriously and two they may not take
me seriously and they'll be like great
let's do this once I'm like yeah but I
want to do like every week for like
three months
oh well I don't have time okay great
well who can I pay to help me right
paying for help it's just like it's like
you've got a contract and you've got
expectations and expectations aren't
muddled with relationships or friendship
or you know
feigned relationship
so pay for help
you know buy speed
okay here's a couple things
um
that I know
people on the top don't on the
people below them they don't so don't
even think for a minute that if you put
out information about how to grow a cash
practice I'm going to come and be like
oh look Jennifer's teaching someone how
to do this I'm gonna go on you and
talk to you no
it's you know I'm looking forward I'm
looking to see who can I who can I learn
from to be better
you know like I said you know I'll teach
you how to fish and I've taught plenty
of my clients how to coach others but
you know don't come to my secret fishing
spot you know and try to get there
before me because
I'll out compete you I'll Market you
outgrow you but I'm going to show you
how to fish because the pond is big and
there's plenty of secret fishing spots
okay but don't think that
um for a minute any one of the trolls
that you're gonna get is someone who's
doing better than you it's only the
people that um well look when you get a
troll or a hater that means you're doing
something right
and when they come just know that they
have no power there's no power they can
have over you because you're doing
something that they couldn't possibly do
themselves
so
you know it can make you uncomfortable
it was terrible I had a hard time with
it for a long time until I gained some
respect perspective on it okay here's um
I've already told you some things you
need to do to grow to the next level
but here's some very specific things to
grow and get the next level I don't you
know what like there's some of the
negative stuff is great because it can
resonate because our brains think in the
negative but I want to give you some
positive things
so the positive spin is one get
uncomfortable like I said growth doesn't
happen in your comfort zone you should
purposefully be getting uncomfortable on
a regular basis whether that's physical
exercise mental exercise working on
yourself go see a therapist and work on
your do some personal
self-development books and tapes on
tapes growth courses
get uncomfortable look even as a your
your coach like it's not you don't hire
me to be your friend you hire me to help
you and if something I say makes you
uncomfortable that's okay that's where
the growth happens you don't always have
to do what I say
but I wouldn't tell you to do something
I would never do myself
and I wouldn't recommend doing something
that I didn't think was going to be
helpful no the strategies may not always
work but it may not just work the first
time it's got there's a lot of different
reasons why things don't work there's a
whole Market message match there's the
copywriting there's the intention
there's the timing there's the Facebook
algorithm
Etc but you got to get uncomfortable and
you gotta be comfortable being
uncomfortable
like take a cold shower go for a bike
ride in the 45 degree rain
you know get uncomfortable
go just do yoga
okay number two set goals
set goals and work hard towards them
both physical business and for your
family right so physical goal of mine is
strong first certification not because I
want the certification because I know
that snatching a 24 kilogram kettlebell
which is 53 pounds
overhead 100 times in five minutes is
like when I set that goal three or four
years ago you know three years ago in
2020 I knew it was an impossible goal
for me I was like there's no way my body
can do that now I know I can I just want
to do it before I'm 50 because at the
age of 50 the test weight goes down to
20 kilograms and I snatched that 100
times in five minutes and 45 seconds
yesterday so I know I can do that one
that's a cardiovascular
limitation for me uh business goal I
wanna 75 members of my Mastermind 100
members in Mastermind I want a million
dollars in monthly uh written recurring
Revenue so 85 000 in MMR and monthly mrr
um three to five million dollars in my
business
um 10 million dollars in uh net worth in
assets uh real estate
um
uh stocks Investments Etc
okay goal for my family 81 days of
vacation a year with a member of my
family you know take my kids skiing two
times a year
Etc I mean and then not just set your
goals but work hard towards them okay
setting a goal isn't enough you actually
have to work hard we talked about that
you got to work hard you got to work
smart but you got to work hard and
sometimes that means sacrificing two or
three hours on a Saturday
maybe getting up at 5 a.m you know like
don't don't come to me like Aaron I
can't do it I don't have enough time
okay if you don't have enough time and
you're busy our number one goal isn't
doing more things it's buying your time
back
either by hiring things hiring people
Outsourcing
quitting a job something you know maybe
the first thing we have to do isn't
working on new patients it's getting you
more time because time is more valuable
than money if you don't have time if you
truly don't have time
then we need to strategize on how to do
that but if you don't have kids don't
tell me you don't got time if you only
got a 40-hour week job and no kids you
got time you're just not prioritizing it
even if you have kids
and you have a you know family member or
partner spouse someone who can watch the
kids for a couple hours on Saturday you
have plenty of time to do this you do
you just have to prioritize it and
sometimes you got to sacrifice other
things
for the long-term goal
okay number three hire a coach what does
that do
it allows you to time collapse your
results you can compress your results
from five years into one year or two
months I don't know it took me a long
time to make 40K in a week and Brandon
Smith did it in the first week we
started working together it took me
years to do thirty thousand dollars in
monthly recurring revenue and just Jenny
did that in two and a half years working
together I mean it's like it's called
time collapse your results
okay go to events
um masterminds events be in the right
room you gotta be in the right room you
can go to events and be in the wrong
room but here's what being in the right
room does it allows you to be with other
people so I can so you know there's this
whole glass ceiling well to see if the
ceiling's glass you can see what it
looks like upstairs you just can't get
through it right I'm not talking about
glassing most of you are walking around
and there's like a drop ceiling you know
or concrete and you can't see what it
looks like
as long as you can see what it looks
like
then you can visualize yourself in that
room and you can get there
okay because no matter what I can make a
staircase for you cut a hole whatever
that room is like but I need you to be
able to see in the other room and I'm
not just going to have some glass we're
just going to open a hole for you you
can see in there and I'm going to drop a
ladder down
but it's your choice to climb the ladder
and you do that by being at events by
being in masterminds
the being in the right room because
success success leaves Clues and you get
environmental exposure to people that
are thinking like you want to think
um look I just got back from an event
it's called operation black site we meet
three times a year for two days it's for
high level entrepreneurs
um who want to get together and
experience it was like to become a Laura
Croft or Jason Bourne right you're
someone who's incredibly smart and
successful but is a is a physical weapon
so we did self-defense and tactical
training and martial arts uh day one and
we did handgun uh training and skills
and room clearing on day two we did uh
some survival Escape resistance and
evasion strategies during lunch we had
uh
um a physician who specializes in uh
Men's Health and works with ex Special
Forces and high level entrepreneurs talk
one day for lunch another guy who's like
worth loads of money to talk about
money mindset the next day
um I paid twenty thousand dollars to be
in the right room you know when Pedro's
told me about this I was like take my
money I don't really care I'm just gonna
be there I miss 20 000 bucks to be in
the right room three times a year
okay so that's like 600 666 dollars per
event plus the hotel which is 250 a
night plus the first class flight which
is twelve hundred dollars so I basically
paid 8 600 bucks to be at a two-day
event
that put me in the right room he was
away from the clinic but the clinics on
you know autopilot like I don't need to
be in the clinic for it to grow and make
money I don't need to be in my office
here in Greensburg for the coaching
business to make money and while I was
there it was sold
when I was there I sold 30 something
tickets to PT bizcon
I wasn't working for it actively trading
time for money I wrote the emails on the
flight out there so I paid uh 8 600
bucks to be in the right room I'm at a
two-day event when you're ready when you
make a decision you want to make a
decision fast So the faster you made a
decision the faster you can take action
the faster you'll experience success
and there's once you once you do that
there are no wrong decisions there are
just lessons you learn and shifts that
you make in your business I'll see you
on the next episode thanks for listening

what you got out of this so if you want
to comment below
