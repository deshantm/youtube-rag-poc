don't want to miss it so today
what you're going to learn are
the six simple ways to create a
six-figure physical therapy business and
there's just a few things you need so
before we get into that I want you to
know my name is Dr Aaron labauer I am a
physical therapist I am a massage
therapist I am a yoga teacher a former
semi-professional cyclist a Sagittarius
and I love cool old things like vintage
Vespas lambrettas I have a VW Vanagon
Etc
for the last eight years since 2013 I've
been coaching other physical therapists
how to launch grow and scale their
physical therapy businesses to create
even more time income and impact
and one of the number one questions I
get is you know Aaron um how do I make
six figures like six figures as a
physical therapist feels almost
impossible especially graduating PT
school
and coming out with a hundred thousand
hundred fifty thousand even three
hundred fifty thousand dollars in
student loan debt just from PT school
and yes I've worked with people that
have over I have multiple hundreds of
thousands of dollars in student loan
debt and help them launch and grow uh
successful cash based practices
specifically
um Matt zanis who's out in Scottsdale
Arizona and
um he came to me as a new grad he had
been doing a like post-grad uh residency
and was getting ready to start in
clinical rotation or not I wanted to
start his own business
and he was telling me he was you know
almost securing fifty thousand dollars
in uh financing for this and he was
really worried that if he went and did
the financing and add on top of his 260
000 in student debt he was just going to
be underwater and how did he have to do
it so what we did is we put him through
my course the cash PT blueprint
and through the course he was able to
launch and grow his business to multiple
six figures and uh
and creates an amazing impact
um for the patients and Financial
Freedom for himself
so I've I've had this experience same
experience with dozens and dozens of
people over the year many of them go on
to my Platinum Mastermind program so
that we can scale up their business hire
their first uh or next employee and free
themselves from their business so that
they no longer have a job
people like Amanda Worley who is
actually right now in the process of
hiring new staff she's moved from a
mobile business to in person and others
like Ben baggy who did six figures right
out of school
and started working together with me
doing 22 000 a month but what really
moved him forward I was just on the
phone with him yesterday what really
moved him forward to 65 was hiring other
PTS
and then what's allowed him to open
location number two in La he went from
Oakland to LA and then back to Iowa to
open location two and three was to take
himself completely out of the business
so we're not there yet this video we're
going to talk about how do you make six
figures
so if you're thinking there's no way I
could make six figures in my own
business or I'm struggling and you know
maybe I'm doing three thousand five
thousand dollars a month and I made
seventy six thousand dollars last year
how do I get to six figures
the problem is you're thinking with your
current product service and pricing you
know and you're like well how do I
possibly do that because I'm seeing 28
people a week you know I'm barely CR I'm
barely you know surviving or maybe I'm
not even seeing 28 people a week you
know I am seeing uh you know like only
10 and I'm nowhere close well this is
the same problem that my coach Pedro's
coolian
um shared with me when he said Aaron you
know in the next few years I want you
generating three to five million dollars
a year and I was like okay B that sounds
great
but how am I going to generate three to
five million dollars in a year he said
well you're thinking with uh or in terms
of your current products pricing and
programs he's like you'll be raising
your rates there'll be more people in
your Mastermind and as The Mastermind
grows the price will go and you know
then that's how we get there so we have
to do math with different numbers
so in order to create a six-figure
business there's a couple things you
need
uh to be successful one you need to know
your avatar
so you need to know
who your perfect patient or customer or
client is you need to know your avatar
you need to know
what their name is what color hair they
have where they go shopping how many
kids they have how much they earn where
they uh like to work out where they get
their hair done what color clothes they
wear where they shop online what
Facebook groups are in ETC my challenge
to you would be to write a 500 word
essay describing a very specific person
so that when you go and write content
for your website your eBooks online you
come to YouTube you know exactly who
you're speaking to I know when I create
videos YouTube videos for my channel
LeBauer PT I know I'm speaking to Jenny
and Robert
I just know that so I'm speaking to them
and I'm not speaking to everyone I'm not
speaking to you guys I'm speaking to
Jenny and Robert or just really Jenny
because I know when Jenny comes in she's
going to bring Robert in
you need to know your niche
your Niche is not the techniques you've
learned and it's not the body part or
problem you solve
your Niche is
who do you help in the transformation
you help them achieve
so at labauer Physical Therapy we help
active people in Greensboro stay fit
healthy and strong without pain meds
injections and surgery Labour Consulting
I help passionate physical therapists
scale their time income and impact
without relying on insurance companies
so that means you can start a cash
practice or an online business or
contract somewhere you're just not
relying on insurance companies and
you're passionate and you're willing to
do whatever it takes to help your
patient
that's my Niche and very close to my
avatar my coaching Avatar is a
combination of let's say Jess and Ben
so who's your proven offer so really I
will say well it's Ben I describe Ben
Jess is you know the other variation she
had a part-time uh
um travel job but also doing uh online
sales uh wonderless PTS
and uh the pandemic came around she lost
her travel job
okay so she went all in on her business
enrolled in The Mastermind program and
uh the first thing we did paid for her
year in the program and she's more than
doubled her revenue from 65 to 120 000 a
year all online nuts right
but totally possible totally deserving
both Ben and Jess Amanda Elizabeth
they're all on the track to generating
even more income more time for
themselves and their family and more
impact for their patients and
communities
so you know your avatar you got your
Niche you need a proven offer whether
it's a free lead Magnet or
enrolling people into your Physical
Therapy Program
she's so you need to proven offer and
sales process so is are we selling
Physical Therapy are we selling a course
no we are selling the transformation
that we defined in the niche and then
you have to price it accordingly or
correctly I know physical therapists
who've generated seven figures a million
dollars with a 75 PDF
now no others that have done the same
with 35
000 programs so the more less you charge
the more volume you need
I mean I know physical therapists who
are doing that uh with five and twenty
dollar margins doing retail and Drop
Shipping
so you need a proven offer you need
something that works and then you have
to price it correctly
how do you know how to price your
services
well I can't tell you exactly but think
about this what's the value that you
deliver for people what's the
transformation that you help them make
and what's the problem you solve
and if that problem's worth ten thousand
dollars you can charge a thousand if the
problem's worth a hundred thousand
dollars you can charge ten thousand I
mean you could charge you know one
percent less but when we're creating
effective sales think about
delivering so much value that the
person's like there's no reason I
wouldn't do this because I'm getting a
thousand dollars worth of value for a
hundred bucks
so when you're treating someone
one-on-one
you really need to be treating in the
you know 150 up Zone like even 200 250.
I know people charging 350 and 450 for
one hour of physical therapy and others
charging 75 or even twenty five dollars
a muscle to do dry needling and they're
struggling the people who charge more
have more time more impact and uh can
scale their business faster
so here are six ways to make a hundred
thousand dollars per year
let me see if I can help draw this out a
little bit
let's see
are you getting this I would love to
know like drop a little comment below
let me know what your number one Insight
is or what's been most helpful for you
about this
um
let's see if this is going to want to
come up
there
sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't
so there's six ways to generate
100 000 let me see if I can do
you want to come on I was gonna try to
bring on my iPad
let's see if I can do this turn it off
turn it back on
and I would love to draw it out so
there's six ways to make a hundred
thousand dollars I mean number one is
charge a hundred thousand dollars
how simple is that charge a hundred
thousand dollars like what would you do
for someone for a hundred thousand
dollars
would you travel around the country with
them
you know get on their private jet and
fly with them and
you know prep their meals every day
and work out with them and write their
program and treat them like once a week
maybe
every day you know you train them maybe
you're a massage therapist MPT like me
do a little massage some days you do uh
some high level training on other days
you do corrective exercises
right so here we go
let's see if we can do this
there it is and
I want to do
I want to do this guy
um
crop split screen I want to
do picture in picture
ha let's see oh
um
let's do this
ah there we go okay got it all right
so six ways to make six figures actually
I just gave you a bonus so it's
um
one person
one
times let's make this guy a little
bigger
so you need one person one patient
times
one hundred thousand dollars
so just imagine someone paid you a
hundred thousand dollars eighty four
hundred dollars a month
and what could you do for them like why
why would that be important to them like
what would you like what would that
service look like
okay that's not super realistic but I
know people out there who've been the
personal physical therapist for
executives who fly around the world and
uh they do this kind of thing I don't
know what they're charging them
um or they're working for the executives
or high level athletes like what is
LeBron James's physical therapist do for
him or even Kobe
um Kobe had a personal physical
therapist I don't I think those guys
might have had the same person I don't
know if she was employed by the Lakers
as much as employed by them but I do
know
acupuncturists who've been flown around
the country to go to their clients uh
homes uh NFL football players and
they're charging like 350 an hour and
the guys will fly them in and they'll
treat like their whole like you know
defensive line like all eight guys you
know Thursday and Friday before the game
on Sunday or Friday and Saturday you
know like Thursday Friday so they give
them a day or two for the game on Sunday
and they fly them in I mean that's uh
should find making like 5000 and dollars
if not ten thousand on a weekend
and do that 12 times a year
okay so the other thing you need let's
go more realistic and say if you're
charging what we're charging you need
4.5 patients
per month
on a 19
98 program
all you need are four and a half
patients a month
okay so one month five one month four so
about one person a week to buy a two
thousand dollar program
at your clinic
or your online business
I've done both online
and in the clinic generally we get about
15 new patients a month and I've sold my
course to cash PG blueprint
for 1997.
and I've had you know anywhere from six
to 25 people enroll per month on
autopilot depending on whether I'm doing
a live webinar that month or a special
or something else
okay so you say oh I don't know what I'm
gonna do for two thousand dollars well a
typical eight visit plan of care in our
Clinic is 1998 and we see people about
once a week
so you might be saying oh I don't know
about that Aaron you got something
special and maybe you're right but I've
taught dozens of people how to do the
same so let's see okay
8.4
patience
times a thousand dollars
okay all you need to do is enroll 8.4
patients or clients every month for a
thousand dollars and you've got six
figures
okay now what we're talking is
um at a thousand dollars let's say you
did uh
innate visit plan of care times a
thousand dollars let me just do my math
that's 125 a visit not bad I think
that's a little low
but at one point in my life about eight
years ago nine years ago we were
charging 125 a visit
okay you need 11 people at 199.
I know and work with many people who are
charging 199 per visit
the people have the best success still
enroll patients into a plan of care and
it works out to about 199 or maybe 190
on a um on a paid in full package but
that's 11 visits a week totally doable
that's two patients a day wouldn't you
say that you could probably uh figure
out how to build a business to generate
two patients a day
let me know below I'd love to know like
let me know in the chat or the comment
below
okay okay let's say you're like oh 200 a
visit I don't want to charge that okay
well then really you only need
what happened here I'm on the you need
12 people at at 175 a visit
so wouldn't you say the difference
between 175 and 199 I mean that seems
like a lot right but that's just one
more patient a week
so maybe you'll feel comfortable about
it but let me put it this way if you're
gonna help Mrs Jones
get back you know like recover from her
knee pain so she can get back to
CrossFit so she can feel strong healthy
and like a good role model for her
daughter wouldn't you say the difference
between a thousand dollars and two
thousand dollars is pretty small to give
her that result
okay and one more way
to make six figures as a physical
therapist in a in a physical therapy
business is to see 28 people at 75
dollars
per week so 28 people per week per visit
or what do you have to do
if you're going to sell a 75 download
okay
that's a million divided by seventy five
dollars that's 13 333 downloads at 75
dollars
okay
now which one would you rather do
would you rather see tons of people for
less money or would you rather spend
meaningful time with your patients and
charge what you're worth or even still
charge under value even though you're
charging a lot
so
hope that by the end of this uh video
you understand exactly what you need to
do to create six figures at in a
physical therapy business now once you
generate six figures in gross profit
then your next
um your next challenge is to generate
six figures in uh
net profit so take home like how do you
take home eighty four hundred dollars
what you have to do is you have to start
looking at how do I get myself out of
the business stop trading time for money
by automating online sales or hiring
other physical therapists to treat
patients
and then we can talk about how do you
bring home 8 400 a month to your bank
account
and you're not on pay maybe you're on
payroll but you're not taking home a
like uh someone used this word the other
day it was it wasn't a word for a salary
it was like
um and I was like no isn't it as a
business owner you don't you you are on
salary but you can be on salary but
there was another term for it and I was
like you're not uh a servant employee
servant of your own business
you um you generate uh profit so
there are just one more fact and one
more thing I want to share with you
there are plenty of businesses out there
that are doing six figures even seven
figure even seven and eight figures like
they're eight figure businesses out
there and the people that own them
aren't bringing home six figures a year
because they're not following a profit
first model they've not organized their
business in the correct way so if you
have a six-figure business and you'd
like to scale it so you can generate six
figures in profit I'd love to get on a
free
um scale session and strategy call with
